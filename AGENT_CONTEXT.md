## Project Vision
Build a hybrid platform where users can prototype apps in a web UI, then export to full local ownership via a single `npx` command. Zero lock-in, unlimited customization.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Export-First**: Everything designed for local ownership
2. **Cursor-Native**: Optimized for Claude Code + Cursor workflow
3. **Zero Lock-In**: Platform is optional after export
4. **Transparency**: Explicit complexity, no magic black boxes
5. **Developer-Centric**: Built for developers, by developers

## Architecture Overview
```
dawson-does-framework/
├── bin/framework.js       # Main CLI entry point
├── src/dd/                 # Core framework modules
├── website/                # Next.js web configurator
├── templates/              # Starter templates (saas, seo-directory, etc.)
├── packages/               # Shared packages (ai-agent, deploy-engine, etc.)
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

## Key Flows
1. **Web → Local**: User configures in web UI → saves to Supabase → `npx @jrdaws/framework pull <token>` → full project locally
2. **CLI Export**: `framework export saas ./my-app --auth supabase` → scaffolds project with integrations
3. **Development**: Open in Cursor → Claude Code assists → deploy

## Coding Standards
- **Language**: TypeScript for website, JavaScript (.mjs) for CLI
- **Style**: 2-space indent, no semicolons in .mjs, semicolons in .ts
- **Naming**: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for components/classes
- **Commits**: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- **Testing**: Node.js test runner for CLI, Playwright for E2E

## Integration Patterns
- Integrations are optional add-ons, never required
- Each integration has its own directory: `templates/{template}/integrations/{type}/{provider}/`
- Integration metadata lives in `integration.json`
- Missing env vars should warn, not error

## Error Handling
- Always provide actionable error messages
- Include recovery guidance (see `src/dd/recovery-guidance.mjs`)
- Never crash silently - log what went wrong

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Prefer Node.js built-ins when possible
- Pin versions in package.json

## What NOT to Do
- Don't add features not requested
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't change shared configs without coordination
- Don't add console.log debugging (use logger.mjs)
- Don't commit .env files or secrets
- **Don't delete protected files** (see below)
- **Don't create feature branches** (work on `main` only)
- **Don't split fenced output** (see Fenced Output Integrity below)

---

## 📝 Fenced Output Integrity (CRITICAL)

**All agents MUST follow these rules when outputting code blocks, prompts, or documents.**

### The One Block Rule
1. **ONE BLOCK**: All related content goes in ONE fenced block - NEVER split
2. **NO MID-FENCE BREAKS**: Never close a fence to add explanation, then reopen
3. **COMMENTS OVER INTERRUPTIONS**: If clarification needed, use inline comments inside the fence
4. **PRE-FLIGHT CHECK**: Before closing \`\`\`, verify: "Have I included ALL the requested content?"

### Explanation Placement
- **BEFORE**: Explanations go BEFORE the opening fence
- **AFTER**: Follow-up notes go AFTER the closing fence
- **NEVER BETWEEN**: NOTHING goes between multiple fences that should be one

### Pre-Output Verification
Before outputting fenced content:
- [ ] Is this ONE continuous block?
- [ ] Does it contain EVERYTHING requested?
- [ ] Am I about to break out of the fence? (DON'T - use comments instead)

### If Content Is Too Long
1. **SAY SO EXPLICITLY** - Don't silently split
2. **ASK FIRST** - Get user confirmation before splitting
3. **LOGICAL BOUNDARIES** - If splitting, use natural boundaries (by file, by section)

## 🛡️ Protected Files - NEVER DELETE

The following files are **critical to project governance**. Deleting them breaks agent continuity:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` | Project context and standards |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code CLI auto-context |
| `.cursorrules` | Cursor IDE auto-rules |
| `docs/GOVERNANCE_ROADMAP.md` | Governance documentation |
| `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md` | Code style reference |
| `prompts/agents/UNIVERSAL_BOOTSTRAP.md` | Agent initialization |
| `prompts/agents/roles/ROLE_PROTOCOL.md` | Agent lifecycle |
| `prompts/agents/memory/*_MEMORY.md` | Persistent agent memory |

**See `.protected-files` for the complete list.**

If you accidentally delete a protected file, restore it immediately:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- <file-path>
```

---

## 🔀 Git Branch Policy

**All AI agents MUST work on `main` branch only.**

Why:
- Prevents branch divergence and lost work
- Keeps memory files in sync across agents
- Avoids complex merge conflicts
- Changes are immediately visible to all agents

Rules:
1. **Never create feature branches** (humans do that)
2. **Commit frequently** (after each significant change)
3. **Pull before starting**: `git pull origin main`
4. **Push after committing**: `git push origin main`

---

## ⚡ Commit Checkpoint Policy

**Commit every 15-20 minutes or after any significant change.**

Commit when:
- ✅ Completing any task in the task queue
- ✅ Updating memory files
- ✅ Creating or modifying 3+ files
- ✅ Before ending session (ALWAYS)

Commit message format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, test, refactor
Example: docs(agents): update CLI memory with session notes
```

---

## 🔍 Check for Active Agents (Anti-Collision)

Before starting work, check if other agents might be active:

```bash
# 1. Check recent commits (last 10 minutes = potential active agent)
git log --oneline --since="10 minutes ago"

# 2. Check for uncommitted changes
git status

# 3. Check terminal files (Cursor-specific)
ls -la ~/.cursor/projects/*/terminals/
```

**If you detect another agent may be active:**
- Coordinate tasks to avoid overlap
- Focus on different files/areas
- Commit and push frequently

---

## Before You Start

1. **Sync check** (CRITICAL - do this FIRST):
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   git status
   git checkout HEAD -- .  # Restores any missing tracked files
   ```
2. Run `npm test` to ensure tests pass
3. Check for active agents (see above)
4. Read the specific files for your task area
5. Ask if anything is unclear

## When You're Done

1. Run `npm test` to verify
2. Run `npm run lint` if available
3. Update your memory file (`prompts/agents/memory/[ROLE]_MEMORY.md`)
4. Commit with conventional commit message
5. Push to origin: `git push origin main`
6. Note any follow-up tasks needed

---

## 🎭 Agent Identity Rule (MANDATORY)

**Every agent MUST end their final response with their role declaration:**

```
I am the [ROLE] Agent.
```

Examples:
- "I am the CLI Agent."
- "I am the Platform Agent."
- "I am the Documentation Agent."

This rule is non-negotiable and applies to ALL responses, regardless of task complexity or context.
