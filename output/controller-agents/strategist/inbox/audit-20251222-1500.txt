## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met ✅

- [x] **CLI export working** - Full export with all integration flags
- [x] **Template system with integrations** - 6 templates, all passing validation
- [x] **Web configurator with preview** - Streaming UI with retry logic
- [x] **Pull command for web→local** - Complete with --cursor flag support
- [x] **AI generation engine** - Multi-stage pipeline complete
- [x] **Model tier selection** - fast/balanced/quality tiers working
- [x] **Streaming UI with progress** - SSE streaming with time estimates
- [x] **Parallel stage execution** - Code+Context run in parallel
- [x] **Live API validation** - All 3 tiers validated with real API
- [x] **Cost optimization** - 61% reduction achieved ($0.18 → $0.07)
- [x] **693 tests passing** - Up from 668
- [x] **Quick Start Guide** - docs/guides/QUICK_START.md created
- [x] **Deploy command audit** - All CLI patterns verified

### Goals In Progress
- [ ] **Production deployment** - Prep complete, awaiting actual deploy - 90%
- [ ] **User testing** - Not started - 0%

### Goals Not Started
- [ ] **Chunked code generation** - For complex projects
- [ ] **Visual code editing** - Edit generated code in browser
- [ ] **Multiple template support** - Generate for multiple templates

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P1)
1. **Production Deployment Not Executed**
   - Impact: Platform not publicly accessible
   - Status: All prep work done, just needs actual `vercel deploy`
   - Owner: Website Agent or human operator

### Important Gaps (P2)
1. **Code Generation Truncation for Complex Projects**
   - Impact: Large multi-file outputs may be incomplete
   - Workaround: Use 'quality' tier for complex projects
   - Future fix: Implement chunked generation

2. **Storage Integrations Missing**
   - Impact: Zero storage providers (UploadThing needed)
   - Status: Documented in INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md
   - Owner: Integration Agent

### Minor Gaps (P3)
1. **Declared but Unimplemented Integrations**
   - Paddle, SendGrid, PlanetScale declared but not implemented
   - Status: Documented in INTEGRATION_AUDIT.md

2. **Test Coverage for integrations.mjs**
   - Integration loader functions lack dedicated tests
   - Not critical - E2E tests cover functionality

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| None currently | - | - | - |

Previous blockers resolved:
- ✅ Code truncation fixed (maxTokens increased to 32K)
- ✅ Haiku model reliability fixed (JSON repair added)
- ✅ Configure page React error fixed (dynamic imports)

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Execute Production Deployment**
   - Run `vercel deploy` in website directory
   - Follow checklist at `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Set all environment variables
   - Run smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke:prod`

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Begin User Testing**
   - Deploy to production
   - Collect real user feedback on generation quality
   - Monitor cost tracking metrics

2. **Implement UploadThing Storage Integration**
   - Follow guide at `docs/integrations/ADDING_INTEGRATIONS.md`
   - Use template at `templates/saas/integrations/_example/`

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Set Up Error Monitoring**
   - Follow `docs/deployment/ERROR_MONITORING.md`
   - Integrate Sentry for production error tracking

2. **Implement Paddle Payments**
   - P1 priority in INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md
   - Platform provider exists, needs template integration
