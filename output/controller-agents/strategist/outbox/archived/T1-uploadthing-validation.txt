# Task: Validate UploadThing Storage Integration

Priority: P1 (CRITICAL PATH)
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (1-2 hours)
Existing Task: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-uploadthing-validation.txt

## Context
The UploadThing storage integration was completed in commit dd95924. Before production deployment, we MUST verify:
1. Integration files are complete and valid
2. TypeScript compiles without errors
3. Component imports work correctly

This is the first storage integration and sets the pattern for future integrations.

## Objectives
1. Validate integration.json schema compliance
2. Verify all 6 integration files exist and are syntactically correct
3. Run TypeScript compilation check
4. Test component import resolution
5. Verify .env.example documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] integration.json passes JSON parse and has required fields
- [ ] All files exist: route.ts, core.ts, file-upload.tsx, uploadthing.ts
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes for integration files
- [ ] Component can be imported in a test file
- [ ] UPLOADTHING_TOKEN documented in .env.example
