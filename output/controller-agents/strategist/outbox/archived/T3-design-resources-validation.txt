# Task: Validate Design Resources System

Priority: P2 (NEW SYSTEM VERIFICATION)
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T1 (do this second)
Estimated Effort: Low (30-60 min)
Existing Task: output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-design-resources-validation.txt

## Context
A design resources system was recently implemented:
- design-quality.md prompt for code generation
- tokens.json for design tokens
- loadDesignReference() function in code-generator

This needs verification before relying on it for production generation.

## Objectives
1. Verify design-quality.md exists in src/prompts
2. Verify design-quality.md is copied to dist/prompts after build
3. Validate tokens.json is valid JSON
4. Test loadDesignReference() doesn't error

## Success Criteria
- [ ] packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md exists
- [ ] packages/ai-agent/dist/prompts/design-quality.md exists
- [ ] templates/saas/design/tokens.json is valid JSON
- [ ] Code generator loads design reference without error

## Files to Review
- packages/ai-agent/src/code-generator.ts (loadDesignReference function)
- packages/ai-agent/src/prompts/design-quality.md
- templates/saas/design/tokens.json

## Handoff
1. Create validation report in output/testing-agent/outbox/
2. Move task from inbox/ to done/
3. If issues found, create bug report for Platform Agent
4. Update Testing Agent memory file
