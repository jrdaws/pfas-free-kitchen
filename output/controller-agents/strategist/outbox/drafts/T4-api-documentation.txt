# Task: Update API Documentation

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
Recent Platform Agent work added several new API endpoints:
- /api/health (health check)
- /api/admin/usage (admin monitoring)
These need documentation following API_CONTRACTS.md standards.

## Objectives
1. Document /api/health endpoint
2. Document /api/admin/usage endpoint  
3. Update docs/api/ with new endpoint documentation
4. Ensure examples follow API_CONTRACTS.md format

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Health endpoint documented with response schema
- [ ] Admin usage endpoint documented with auth requirements
- [ ] Examples are runnable (curl commands)
- [ ] Linked from main API docs index

## Files to Modify
- docs/api/health.md (create)
- docs/api/admin-usage.md (create)
- docs/api/README.md (update index)

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Write completion report
3. Update memory file
