# Task: UploadThing Validation

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None (can run parallel to T1/T2)
Estimated Effort: Medium (~30 min)

## Context
UploadThing storage integration was completed in Cycle 6 but never tested. The 
Auditor flagged this as a P1 gap. This task validates the integration works.

## Objectives
1. Verify UploadThing integration scaffolds correctly
2. Test file upload functionality (if API key available)
3. Ensure graceful degradation without API key

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Export with UploadThing integration includes correct files
- [ ] Generated code compiles without errors
- [ ] Upload component renders (even without API key)
- [ ] Proper warning shown when API key missing

## Commands
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
npx @jrdaws/framework export saas ./test-uploadthing --storage uploadthing
cd test-uploadthing
npm install
npm run build
```

## Files to Check
- templates/saas/integrations/storage/uploadthing/
- Generated UploadThing components

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Document test results in outbox/
3. If issues found, create bug fix task for Integration Agent
