# Task: Update Deployment Guides

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: T3 (Vercel deployment complete)
Estimated Effort: Low (~20 min)

## Context
Once deployed to Vercel, deployment guides need to reflect actual process and 
any lessons learned. Dead links to vercel.md/netlify.md were flagged in testing.

## Objectives
1. Create or update docs/deployment/vercel.md
2. Add actual production URL and configuration steps
3. Document any gotchas or issues encountered

## Success Criteria
- [ ] docs/deployment/vercel.md exists with accurate content
- [ ] Production URL documented
- [ ] Environment variable setup documented
- [ ] No dead links in documentation

## Files to Create/Modify
- docs/deployment/vercel.md
- docs/deployment/README.md (if exists)
- Quick Start Guide (add deployment section if missing)

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit with: git add -A && git commit -m "docs(deployment): add Vercel deployment guide"
3. Update PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md to remove deployment guide from backlog
