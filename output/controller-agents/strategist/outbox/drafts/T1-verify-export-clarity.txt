# Task: Verify Export Clarity Changes

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (~20 min)

## Context
Recent commits (cbca859) added export clarity messaging to address user confusion 
about ZIP vs CLI export. The Auditor flagged this as a critical gap. Verification 
is required before production deployment.

## Objectives
1. Verify Export UI clearly differentiates Full Template vs Starter Structure
2. Verify ZIP README explains what's included/not included
3. Verify post-download modal guides users to CLI for full template

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Option A shows "Full Template" with "Recommended" badge
- [ ] Option B shows "Starter Structure" with warning styling
- [ ] ZIP README has "⚠️ This is a STARTER STRUCTURE" section
- [ ] Post-download modal has "Copy Full Template Command" button
- [ ] Run website E2E tests pass

## Commands
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework/website
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000/configure
# Complete steps and test export
```

## Files to Check
- website/app/components/configurator/ExportView.tsx
- website/lib/zip-generator.ts

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Update MINDFRAME.md with verification status
3. If PASS: Hand off to Platform Agent for deployment (T3)
4. If FAIL: Hand off to Website Agent with specific issues
