# Task: User Feedback Collection Endpoint

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: T1 (Production Deployment)
Estimated Effort: Medium

## Context
With Phase 1 complete and production deployment underway, we need to collect
structured user feedback to guide Phase 2 development. This is essential for
validating generation quality and UX decisions.

## Objectives
1. Create POST /api/feedback endpoint
2. Store feedback in Supabase (simple schema)
3. Include generation context (project config, tier used)
4. Basic rate limiting (prevent spam)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Feedback endpoint exists and works
- [ ] Feedback stored in Supabase with timestamps
- [ ] Rate limited (5 submissions per IP per hour)
- [ ] Admin endpoint to view aggregated feedback

## Files to Modify
- website/app/api/feedback/route.ts (create)
- website/lib/supabase/schema.sql (add feedback table)
- website/app/components/configurator/FeedbackForm.tsx (create)

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Write completion report
3. Provide SQL migration for Supabase
4. Update memory file
