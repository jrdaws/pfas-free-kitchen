# Task: Scaffold Integrations Without Env Check

Priority: P1
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)

## Context
Users report that exporting projects with integrations (e.g., Stripe) fails 
because the CLI requires environment variables during scaffolding. This should 
only validate at runtime, not scaffold time.

## Objectives
1. Remove or defer env validation during export scaffold
2. Add validation only when running npm run dev or building
3. Generate .env.local.example with all required vars

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `npx @jrdaws/framework export ecommerce ./myapp` works without env vars
- [ ] Generated project includes .env.local.example with all vars
- [ ] README includes clear env setup instructions
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Commands
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
npm test  # Before changes
# Make changes
npm test  # After changes
```

## Files to Modify
- bin/framework.js
- src/dd/export.mjs
- templates/*/template.json

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit with: git add -A && git commit -m "feat(cli): allow export without env vars"
3. Hand off to Testing Agent to verify with all templates
