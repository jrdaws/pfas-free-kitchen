# Task: Implement Chunked Code Generation

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Platform Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: High

## Context
Current limitation: Code generation truncates at ~12,000 tokens for complex projects.
This affects multi-file outputs for larger SaaS applications.
Current workaround is to use 'quality' tier, but this increases costs.

## Objectives
1. Implement chunked generation strategy for large outputs
2. Maintain context coherence between chunks
3. Support file-by-file generation with cross-file awareness
4. Stay within existing token budget (optimize, don't increase)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complex projects (10+ files) generate completely
- [ ] No loss of context between file generations
- [ ] Generation cost increase < 20%
- [ ] Test coverage for chunked generation

## Files to Modify
- website/lib/ai/generate-code.ts (or similar)
- website/app/api/generate/project/route.ts
- website/lib/project-generator.ts

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Write completion report with before/after metrics
3. Update AI_GENERATION_ENGINE.md with chunked strategy
4. Notify Testing Agent for validation
