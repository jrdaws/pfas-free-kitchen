## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Commit All Uncommitted Work (P0)**: 22 files uncommitted for 3+ cycles is blocking forward progress. This is the #1 priority and must happen IMMEDIATELY.

2. **Break the Execution Gap (P1)**: The systemic issue where governance completes but execution never starts. Testing Agent has been waiting 2+ cycles to execute accordion tests.

3. **Complete UI Test Coverage (P2)**: Accordion sidebar and connected services UI both need testing before we can confidently deploy.

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| T0 | Commit Uncommitted Work | CLI | P0 | Low | None |
| T1 | Complete Accordion UI Tests | Testing | P1 | Medium | T0 |
| T2 | Connected Services UI | Website | P2 | Medium | T0 |
| T3 | Supabase OAuth E2E Tests | Testing | P2 | Medium | T0 |
| T4 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |
| T5 | Create Deployment Guides | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |

### Website Agent
- T2: Connected Services UI (P2)

### Documentation Agent
- T4: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md (P3)
- T5: Create Deployment Guides (P3)

### Platform Agent
- Available for new work

### Template Agent
- Available for new work

### Integration Agent
- Available for new work

## Dependencies Map

```
T0 (P0 - Commit) ──┬──▶ T1 (P1 - Accordion Tests)
                   │
                   ├──▶ T2 (P2 - Connected Services UI)
                   │
                   └──▶ T3 (P2 - OAuth E2E Tests)

T4 (P3 - Coding Standards) ──▶ Independent
T5 (P3 - Deploy Guides) ──▶ Independent
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Continued execution gap | High | High | Place task prompts directly in inboxes; human must activate agents |
| Test failures on commit | Low | Medium | Tests currently at 732 passing (stable 3 cycles) |
| Merge conflicts | Low | Medium | Single branch workflow, frequent commits |
| Agent overload | Low | Medium | Max 2 tasks per agent enforced |

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT included this cycle:
- **Chunked code generation**: P3, Platform team has capacity but not urgent
- **User testing coordination**: Requires external users, not actionable by agents
- **Velocity tracking automation**: Nice to have, can wait for stability

---

## Execution Strategy

**CRITICAL CHANGE FOR CYCLE 14**: To break the systemic execution gap:

1. Task prompts are placed DIRECTLY in agent inboxes (not just outbox/drafts)
2. T0 (commit) must be executed IMMEDIATELY before any other work
3. After T0 completes, T1-T5 can execute in parallel where independent

**Recommended Activation Order:**
```
1. CLI Agent     → T0 (P0) - IMMEDIATE, unblocks everything
2. Testing Agent → T1 (P1) + T3 (P2) in parallel
3. Website Agent → T2 (P2)
4. Documentation Agent → T4 + T5 (P3) in parallel
```

## Success Metrics for This Cycle

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Uncommitted files | 0 | `git status` shows clean |
| Tasks executed | ≥3 of 6 | Completed task files |
| Test count | ≥732 | `npm test` output |
| Accordion tests | Complete | Spec file with passing assertions |
