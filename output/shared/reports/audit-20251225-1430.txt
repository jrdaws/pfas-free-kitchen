## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met (Since Cycle 11)
- [x] All 732 tests remain passing (zero regressions)
- [x] Governance loop completed (Auditor → Strategist → Curator)
- [x] Framework stable and functional

### Goals NOT Met
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Uncommitted work now at 22 files** (3+ cycles overdue)
- [ ] 0 of 6 distributed tasks executed
- [ ] Accordion UI tests still incomplete
- [ ] Connected services UI not started
- [ ] No forward progress on task queue

### Execution Gap Alert ⚠️⚠️⚠️
This is now a **systemic issue** across 3+ cycles:
- Cycle 8: Gap identified (0 tasks executed)
- Cycle 9: Resolved temporarily
- Cycle 10: New tasks distributed
- Cycle 11: 6 tasks distributed, 0 executed
- Cycle 12: **SAME 6 tasks still waiting**

**Pattern**: Governance loop completes (Audit → Strategy → Curation) but executing agents do not pick up inbox tasks.

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **Uncommitted Work Crisis** - 22 files uncommitted for 3+ cycles
   - Modified: 8 files (FRAMEWORK_MAP, PROJECT_PRIORITIES, PROJECT_STATUS, AUDITOR_MEMORY, STRATEGIST_MEMORY, uploadthing-e2e.test.mjs, ACTIVATE_AGENTS, velocity-log.csv)
   - Untracked: 14 files (governance reports, inbox/outbox files, accordion spec)
   - Impact: Work at risk, dirty git status, other agents seeing stale state
   - Action: **IMMEDIATE commit required** (`git add -A && git commit && git push`)

### Important Gaps (P1)
1. **Systemic Execution Gap** - 6 tasks distributed, 0 executed across 2 cycles
   - Impact: Governance overhead without work output
   - Root cause: Agents not being activated to process inboxes
   - Action: Human must launch agents to execute inbox tasks

2. **UI Tests Incomplete** - Accordion sidebar untested
   - File exists but incomplete: `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`
   - Impact: UI bugs may go undetected
   - Action: Testing Agent must complete and run tests

### Minor Gaps (P2/P3)
1. Missing deployment guides (vercel.md, netlify.md, railway.md)
2. CODING_STANDARDS.md referenced but doesn't exist
3. Connected services UI not started (backend ready)
4. Supabase OAuth E2E testing needed

**Total: 22 files uncommitted**

### Recommended Commit Command:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-12 work (governance, tests, reports, tasks)"
git push origin main
```

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Uncommitted work (22 files) | **HIGH** | CLI Agent/Human | `git add -A && git commit && git push` |
| Execution gap (no agent activation) | **HIGH** | Human | Launch agents with inbox tasks |
| Vercel env vars | Low | Human | Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SUPABASE_*, REDIS_* |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Set Root Dir=website in project settings |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 0 (IMMEDIATE - Before Anything Else)
1. **Commit all 22 uncommitted files**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-12 work (governance, tests, reports)"
   git push origin main
   ```
   - This is now 3+ cycles overdue
   - Blocks other agents from seeing complete state

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Break the execution gap** - Activate agents to process inboxes
   - CLI Agent: inbox has P1 commit task
   - Testing Agent: inbox has 2 tasks (accordion + OAuth tests)
   - Website Agent: inbox has connected services UI task
   - Documentation Agent: inbox has 2 documentation tasks

2. **Complete Accordion UI Tests** - Testing Agent
   - File exists: `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`
   - Needs completion and execution

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Connected Services UI** - Website Agent (backend ready)
2. **Supabase OAuth E2E Testing** - Testing Agent

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Create CODING_STANDARDS.md** - Documentation Agent
2. **Create Deployment Guides** - Documentation Agent

## Quality Checklist

- [x] Read all recent git commits (20 commits in 6h window reviewed)
- [x] Ran npm test and recorded results (732 passing)
- [x] Checked all agent memory files (15 files reviewed)
- [x] Identified 4+ actionable items
- [x] Report follows template format
- [x] Handoff file will be placed in Strategist inbox

---

## Root Cause Analysis: Execution Gap

### Why Tasks Are Not Being Executed

1. **No Agent Activation**: Governance agents (Auditor, Strategist, Curator) complete their cycles but no human/automation activates executing agents (CLI, Testing, Website, etc.)

2. **Inbox Files Accumulating**: Tasks pile up in agent inboxes without pickup:
   - CLI: 2 tasks waiting
   - Testing: 8 tasks waiting
   - Website: 8 tasks waiting
   - Documentation: 7 tasks waiting

3. **Commit Blocker Persists**: P0 commit task blocking forward progress but no agent activated to execute it

### Recommended Fix

Either:
a) **Human triggers agent sessions** to process inboxes
b) **Automation** (Keyboard Maestro, cron) activates agents on schedule
c) **Single session commits work** before governance continues

## Handoff

Report saved to: `output/shared/reports/audit-20251225-1430.txt`
Next agent: STRATEGIST
Activation: Read `output/agents/strategist/inbox/` for this report

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

**Before any other work, execute:**
```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-12 work (governance, tests, reports)"
git push origin main
```

This is now **3+ cycles overdue** and blocks all forward progress.
