# Strategy Report

Cycle: 13
Date: 2025-12-25 15:00
Strategist: STRATEGIST Agent
Responding to: audit-20251225-1430.txt

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Commit Uncommitted Work (P0)**: 22 files uncommitted across 3+ cycles is CRITICAL - blocks all other progress and creates risk of lost work
2. **Break Execution Gap (P1)**: 6 tasks distributed in Cycle 11 remain unexecuted - governance loop completes but no work output
3. **Complete UI Tests (P1)**: Accordion sidebar implemented but untested - UI bugs may go undetected

---

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| T0 | Commit All Uncommitted Work | CLI | P0 | Low | None |
| T1 | Complete Accordion UI Tests | Testing | P1 | Medium | T0 |
| T2 | Connected Services UI | Website | P2 | High | T0 |
| T3 | Supabase OAuth E2E Tests | Testing | P2 | Medium | T0 |
| T4 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |
| T5 | Create Deployment Guides | Documentation | P3 | Medium | None |

## Dependencies Map

```
T0 (Commit Work) ─────┬──────▶ T1 (Accordion Tests)
                      │
                      ├──────▶ T2 (Connected Services UI)
                      │
                      └──────▶ T3 (OAuth E2E Tests)

T4 (Coding Standards) ────────▶ (Independent)

T5 (Deployment Guides) ───────▶ (Independent)
```

T0 BLOCKS: T1, T2, T3 - must complete first to unblock other agents.
T4, T5: Can proceed in parallel with T0.

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Commit fails due to conflicts | Low | High | Run `git pull` first, resolve conflicts |
| Accordion tests reveal bugs | Medium | Medium | Fix bugs in same session, update UI |
| OAuth tests need env vars | Medium | Medium | Skip tests requiring external services, mock |
| No agents activated again | High | High | User must launch agents with inbox prompts |

## Draft Task Prompts

### T0: Commit All Uncommitted Work

File: `output/cli-agent/inbox/20251225-1500-P0-task-commit-work.txt`

```
# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (IMMEDIATE - BLOCKS ALL OTHER WORK)
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)

## Context
Auditor reports 22 files uncommitted for 3+ cycles:
- 8 modified files (FRAMEWORK_MAP, PROJECT_PRIORITIES, PROJECT_STATUS, etc.)
- 14 untracked files (governance reports, task drafts, accordion spec)

This blocks all other agents from seeing complete project state.

## Objectives
1. Stage all uncommitted files
2. Create descriptive commit message
3. Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] Changes pushed to origin/main
- [ ] Other agents can pull complete state

## Commands to Execute
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-12 work (governance, tests, reports, tasks)"
git push origin main

## Handoff
1. Confirm commit hash
2. Update CLI_MEMORY.md with commit details
3. Report: "Commit complete, all agents unblocked"
```

```
# Task: Complete Accordion UI Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T0 (Commit Work)
Estimated Effort: Medium (1-2 hours)

## Context

Test file exists but is incomplete: website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts

## Objectives
1. Complete Playwright tests for accordion sidebar
2. Test all section expansions/collapses
3. Test mobile accordion behavior
4. Verify persistence of state

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All accordion tests passing
- [ ] Tests cover: section toggle, multi-section, mobile, persistence
- [ ] npm test includes accordion tests
- [ ] No regressions in existing 732 tests

## Files to Modify
- website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts

## Handoff
1. Run npm test and confirm 732+ tests pass
2. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md
3. Move task to done/
```

### T2: Connected Services UI

```
# Task: Connected Services UI

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: T0 (Commit Work)
Estimated Effort: High (3-4 hours)

## Context
Platform Agent completed backend for connected services:
- OAuth routes: website/app/api/oauth/[provider]/route.ts
- Connected services API: website/app/api/connected-services/route.ts
- Database schema: migrations for connected_services table

UI needed to display connected services status and allow disconnection.

## Objectives
1. Create ConnectedServices component in website/components/configurator/
2. Display connected service status (GitHub, Google, etc.)
3. Add disconnect functionality
4. Integrate into sidebar settings section

## Success Criteria
