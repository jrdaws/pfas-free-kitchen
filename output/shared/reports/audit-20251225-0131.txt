# Audit Report

Cycle: 11
Date: 2025-12-25 01:31
Auditor: AUDITOR Agent

---

## Executive Summary

The framework is in **excellent health** with **732 tests passing** (stable from Cycle 10). The last 6 hours saw **56 commits** continuing exceptional development velocity on the 5DS Clone initiative. Cycle 11 governance completed with Strategist producing 6 task prompts and Curator distributing them to agent inboxes. **Key concern: 4+ uncommitted files persist** from previous cycles - must be addressed.

## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met (Since Cycle 10)
- [x] Cycle 11 governance loop completed (Auditor → Strategist → Curator)
- [x] 6 tasks formulated and distributed
- [x] All tests remain passing

### Goals NOT Met
- [ ] Uncommitted work still persists (CRITICAL - now 4+ files)
- [ ] Accordion UI tests not completed
- [ ] Connected services UI not started
- [ ] No task execution in Cycle 11

### Execution Gap Alert ⚠️
Similar to Cycle 8 issue: governance completed but tasks not executed.
- Strategist produced 6 task prompts
- Curator distributed to inboxes
- **ZERO tasks have been picked up by executing agents**

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P0)
1. **Uncommitted Work Persists** - 4+ files uncommitted for 2+ cycles
   - Impact: Work at risk of loss, dirty git status
   - Action: IMMEDIATE commit required

### Important Gaps (P1)
1. **Execution Gap** - Tasks distributed but not executed
   - Impact: Governance overhead without work output
   - Action: Agents must pick up inbox tasks

2. **UI Tests Incomplete** - Accordion sidebar untested
   - Impact: UI bugs may go undetected
   - Action: Testing Agent should complete configurator-accordion.spec.ts

### Minor Gaps (P2/P3)
1. Missing deployment guides (vercel.md, netlify.md, railway.md)
2. CODING_STANDARDS.md referenced but doesn't exist
3. Connected services UI not started (backend ready)

## Uncommitted Changes (CRITICAL)

| File | Status | Cycles Uncommitted |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| output/shared/PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md | Modified | 1+ |
| output/shared/workspace/PROJECT_STATUS.md | Modified | 1+ |
| prompts/agents/memory/AUDITOR_MEMORY.md | Modified | 1+ |
| tests/integration-tests/uploadthing-e2e.test.mjs | Modified | 2+ |
| website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts | Untracked | 2+ |

| output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/*.txt | Untracked | 1 |
| output/shared/reports/strategy-*.txt | Untracked | 1 |

**Total: 4 modified + 10 untracked files**

**Recommendation**: IMMEDIATE commit with:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit cycle 10-11 work (governance, tests, reports)"
git push origin main
```

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Uncommitted work | Medium | CLI Agent | Commit immediately |
| Vercel env vars | Low | Human | Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SUPABASE_*, REDIS_* in dashboard |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Set Root Dir=website in project settings |
| Task execution gap | Medium | All Agents | Pick up inbox tasks |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 0 (IMMEDIATE)
1. **Commit all uncommitted work** - This is overdue by 2 cycles
   - Run: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-11" && git push origin main`

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Execute distributed tasks** - Curator distributed 6 tasks, none executed
2. **T2: Complete Accordion UI Tests** - New UI feature needs validation

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **T3: Connected Services UI** - Backend ready, frontend needed
2. **T4: Test Supabase OAuth E2E** - Validate integration works

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **T5: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md** - Fix dead link
2. **T6: Create Deployment Guides** - Documentation gap
