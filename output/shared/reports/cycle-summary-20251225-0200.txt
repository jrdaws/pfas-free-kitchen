## Quality Assessment

### Approved Prompts

| Task | Vision | Clarity | Complete | Action | Scope | Total |
|------|--------|---------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| T1: Commit Work | 7 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 9.4 |
| T2: Accordion Tests | 7 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 8.4 |
| T3: Connected Services UI | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 | 7 | 7.8 |
| T4: Supabase OAuth E2E | 7 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 8 | 7.2 |
| T5: CODING_STANDARDS.md | 8 | 10 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 9.4 |
| T6: Deployment Guides | 9 | 8 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 8.0 |

### Rejected Prompts

None - all 6 prompts met minimum quality threshold (7.0)

### Curator Improvements Made

1. **T1**: Updated file list to include additional uncommitted files detected in current git status
2. **T2**: Added reference files (FileTreeView.tsx, accordion.tsx) for testing context
3. **T3**: Added reference files and design notes for UI consistency
4. **T4**: Added testing approach notes for OAuth mocking in CI
5. **T5**: Added reference files for code examples
6. **T6**: Added content template for consistency across guides

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 8 (cycle 10 was highly productive)
- Completion Rate: N/A (tasks just distributed)

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 8 | 5 | 0 | 0% |
| 9 | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| 10 | 5 | 6 | 120% |
| 10b | 5 | 8 | 160% |
| 11 | 6 | 0 | TBD |

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Strategist produced well-structured draft prompts with clear success criteria
- All prompts aligned with project vision and passed quality threshold
- Strong velocity in cycle 10 (56 commits, 732 tests passing)
- Good mix of P1/P2/P3 priorities across multiple agents

### What Needs Improvement
- T4 (OAuth E2E) scored lowest (7.2) due to dependency on T3 not being clearly actionable
- Some uncommitted work from cycle 10 still pending (addressed by T1)
- Could use more specific viewport breakpoints in T2

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Monitor T1 completion before T2 can proceed
- Ensure T3 completes before T4 is started
- Consider parallel execution of T5 and T6 (no dependencies)

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 4/6 | T3, T5, T6 directly support export workflow |
| Zero Lock-In | 3/6 | Connected services UI enables external account integration |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | All tasks designed for Claude + Cursor workflow |
| Transparency | 5/6 | Documentation tasks (T5, T6) improve transparency |
| Fail Gracefully | 2/6 | T5 covers error handling patterns |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: 2025-12-25 08:00 (6 hours from now)
**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- Monitor execution of all 6 distributed tasks

### Watch Items
- T1 must complete before T2 can start
- T3 must complete before T4 can start
- Vercel env var blockers (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SUPABASE_*, REDIS_*)
