## Quality Assessment

### Scoring Breakdown

| Prompt | Vision | Clarity | Complete | Action | Scope | Total |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| LAUNCH-testing | 10 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9.4 |
| LAUNCH-documentation | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9.2 |
| T1-uploadthing | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9.0 |
| T2-deployment | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 8.8 |
| T3-design-resources | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 8.8 |

### Observations

1. **High Quality**: All prompts exceed 8.5/10 - ready for execution
2. **Already Curated**: T1-T3 were curated in Cycle 5, exist in agent inboxes
3. **LAUNCH Prompts**: New in Cycle 8, provide clear agent activation instructions
4. **No Duplication**: Strategist correctly avoided creating new tasks

### Rejected Prompts

None - all prompts met quality threshold.

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 0 (execution focus - correct)
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0 (execution gap persists)
- Completion Rate: 0%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)

| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| 2 | 5 | 7 | 140% | Strong execution |
| 3 | 3 | 0 | 0% | Curator focus |
| 5 | 8 | 2 | 25% | Distribution focus |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 0% | Cleanup cycle |
| 8 | 0 | 0 | 0% | Strategy only |
| 9 | 0 | 0 | 0% | Curation complete |

**Critical Observation**: 16 tasks created, 9 completed. Execution gap = 9 tasks pending.

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Strategist correctly focused on execution over task creation
- Draft prompts are high quality (9.0 average)
- Clear launch commands provided for worker agents
- No duplicate tasks created

### What Needs Improvement
- **Execution gap is CRITICAL**: 4 consecutive cycles without worker execution
- ACTIVATE_AGENTS.txt has been updated 3 times with same recommendations
- Need human intervention to launch worker agents

### Action Items for Next Cycle
1. **STOP CONTROLLER CYCLES** until worker agents execute tasks
2. Launch Testing Agent (2 tasks ready)
3. Launch Documentation Agent (1 task ready)
4. Human should deploy to Vercel after docs complete

| Transparency | 5/5 | Clear success criteria in all tasks |
| Fail Gracefully | 4/5 | Rollback documented in deployment task |

## Executor Launch Commands

**PHASE 1 - LAUNCH IMMEDIATELY**

### Testing Agent (P1 + P2 Tasks)
```
I'm the Testing Agent. Execute these tasks in order:
1. output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-uploadthing-validation.txt
2. output/testing-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-design-resources-validation.txt
Move completed tasks to done/, create reports in outbox/.
```

### Documentation Agent (P2 Task)
```
I'm the Documentation Agent. Execute:
output/documentation-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-deployment-execution-guide.txt
Create docs/deploy/VERCEL_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md, move task to done/.
```

**PHASE 2 - AFTER PHASE 1**

### Platform Agent (Complex Task)
```
Read and execute: output/platform-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P1-task-chunked-code-generation.txt
```

### Website Agent (Blocked on Deployment)
```
Read and execute: output/website-agent/inbox/20251223-1900-P2-task-user-feedback-api.txt
```

## Next Cycle

**Recommended**: PAUSE controller cycles until worker agents execute tasks.

**If worker execution happens**:
- Scheduled Start: 2025-12-24 17:30 (6 hours)
- Trigger: Auditor reads completion reports

### Carry-Forward Items
- All 9 queued tasks (unchanged for 4 cycles)

### Watch Items
- Execution gap resolution
- Vercel deployment status
- UploadThing validation results
