## Quality Assessment

### Approved Prompts

| Task | Vision | Clarity | Complete | Action | Scope | Total | Decision |
|------|--------|---------|----------|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| T0: Commit Work | 9 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 9.8 | ✅ Approve |
| T1: Accordion Tests | 7 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 8.4 | ✅ Approve |
| T2: Connected Services | 8 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 8.0 | ✅ Approve |
| T3: OAuth E2E | 7 | 8 | 8 | 7 | 9 | 7.8 | ✅ Approve |
| T4: Coding Standards | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 9.0 | ✅ Approve |
| T5: Deployment Guides | 8 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 8.6 | ✅ Approve |

### Rejected Prompts

None - all 6 drafts met quality threshold (7.0 minimum).

### Improvements Made

1. **T0 (Commit Work)**: Added git pull first step, expanded success criteria
2. **T1 (Accordion Tests)**: Added specific test cases, keyboard navigation requirement
3. **T2 (Connected Services)**: Added design notes, API route reference, mobile requirement
4. **T3 (OAuth E2E)**: Added mocking strategy guidance, expanded test cases
5. **T4 (Coding Standards)**: Added content outline with specific sections
6. **T5 (Deployment Guides)**: Added content template for consistency across platforms

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0 (CRITICAL - execution gap continues)
- Completion Rate: 0%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| 9 | 5 | 0 | 0% | Execution gap identified |
| 10 | 5 | 6 | 120% | Gap closed temporarily |
| 11 | 6 | 8 | 133% | Healthy execution |
| 12 | 6 | 0 | 0% | Gap re-emerged |
| 13 | 6 | 0 | 0% | Gap critical (3 cycles) |

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Execution gap persists for 3 cycles. Tasks are being created but not executed.

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Governance loop completing reliably (Auditor → Strategist → Curator)
- Draft prompts from Strategist are high quality (all passed review)
- 732 tests remain stable (zero regressions)
- Clear prioritization (P0 commit task blocking all)

### What Needs Improvement
- **Execution gap is critical** - governance creates tasks but no agents execute
- Task accumulation in inboxes (some tasks 2+ cycles old)
- Human activation needed to break the cycle
- Uncommitted work blocking forward progress

### Action Items for Next Cycle
1. **IMMEDIATE**: User must launch CLI Agent to commit work
2. After commit: Launch Testing and Website agents in parallel
3. Consider automation to auto-launch agents after curation
4. Archive duplicate tasks from old cycles

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 6/6 | All tasks support local ownership |
| Zero Lock-In | 6/6 | No vendor dependencies introduced |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | Tasks designed for Claude+Cursor workflow |
| Transparency | 6/6 | Clear success criteria, no magic |
| Fail Gracefully | 4/6 | T3, T4 have some dependency risks |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: 2025-12-25 21:30 (+ 6 hours)
**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- All 6 tasks if not executed
- Inbox cleanup for duplicate tasks

### Watch Items
- Execution gap (now 3 cycles)
- Uncommitted files (22 total)
- Agent activation automation
