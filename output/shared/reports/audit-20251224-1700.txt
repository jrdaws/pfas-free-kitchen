### Goals Not Started

- [ ] Velocity tracking automation (P3)

---

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P1)
- None identified

### Important Gaps (P2)
1. **Vercel primary domain**: Alt domain works, primary needs dashboard Root Dir config
2. **UI tests for configurator**: Coverage gap identified in PROJECT_PRIORITIES

### Minor Gaps (P3)
1. **Missing deployment guides**: vercel.md, netlify.md, railway.md referenced but not created
2. **CODING_STANDARDS.md**: Referenced but doesn't exist

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Vercel dashboard access | Low | Human | Set Root Dir=website in project settings |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Fix Vercel primary domain** - Human action: Set Root Dir=website in dashboard

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Create missing deployment guides** - Documentation Agent can draft
2. **Add UI tests for configurator** - Testing Agent priority

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Add velocity tracking** - Platform Agent can implement
2. **Create user feedback mechanism** - Website Agent enhancement
