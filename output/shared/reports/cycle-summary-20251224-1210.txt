## Quality Assessment

### Approved Prompts

| Task | Clarity | Completeness | Alignment | Actionability | Scope | Total |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------|-------|
| T1: Verify Export Clarity | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9.0 |
| T2: Scaffold Without Env | 8 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 8.4 |
| T3: Deploy to Vercel | 9 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 9 | 8.4 |
| T4: Update Deploy Guides | 8 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 9 | 8.2 |
| T5: UploadThing Validation | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9.0 |

### Rejected Prompts

None - all prompts met minimum threshold (7.0)

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Created: 5
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0 (execution gap from Cycle 8)
- Completion Rate: 0% (this cycle addresses the gap)

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|
| 5 | 8 | 2 | 25% |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | N/A (cleanup) |
| 7 | 5 | 0 | 0% (strategy) |
| 8 | 0 | 0 | N/A (audit) |
| 9 | 5 | 0 | Awaiting execution |

**Note**: Cycles 6-9 were controller-focused. Worker agent execution needed.

---

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Strategist correctly prioritized execution over planning
- All 5 prompts passed quality threshold (avg 8.6)
- Clear dependency chain: T1 → T3 → T4

### What Needs Improvement
- Execution gap: 9+ tasks queued, none executed in 4 cycles
- Need to actually launch worker agents, not just create tasks

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Focus on EXECUTION: Launch Testing Agent and CLI Agent immediately
- Track completion rate, not just task creation

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 5/5 | All tasks support export flow |
| Zero Lock-In | 4/5 | T2 explicitly improves DX |
| Cursor-Native | 5/5 | All tasks include commands |
| Transparency | 5/5 | T1, T4 improve user clarity |
| Fail Gracefully | 3/5 | T2, T5 address error handling |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: After worker agents complete current tasks
**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- P0 Export Mismatch: Addressed by messaging (T1 verifies)
- Chunked Code Generation: Deferred to next cycle

### Watch Items
- T1 result determines if deployment proceeds
- T2 may require investigation if env validation is deep
