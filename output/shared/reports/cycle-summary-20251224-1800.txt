## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- No critical gaps identified - framework is in excellent health
- 34 commits in last 6 hours shows strong velocity
- Agent folder restructuring complete (13/13 agents)
- UploadThing integration validated (6/6 tests pass)
- 694 tests passing, up from 693

### What Needs Improvement
- Some documentation still missing (addressed in this cycle)
- UI test coverage gap for configurator (addressed in this cycle)
- Vercel primary domain still requires human action

### Action Items for Next Cycle
- Monitor completion of documentation tasks
- Verify UI tests are added and passing
- Follow up on Vercel domain configuration
