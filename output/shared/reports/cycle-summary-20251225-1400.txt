## Executive Summary

Cycle 12 focuses on **EXECUTION, NOT PLANNING**. The Strategist identified a critical execution gap: Cycle 11 distributed 6 tasks, but ZERO were executed. This cycle re-distributes the same tasks with urgency messaging.

**Key Action**: T0 (Commit Work) is now P0 priority - must be done FIRST.

## Velocity Metrics

### This Cycle
- Tasks Distributed: 6
- Tasks from Last Cycle Completed: 0 ⚠️
- Completion Rate: 0%

### Trend (Last 5 Cycles)
| Cycle | Created | Completed | Rate | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| 8 | 4 | 0 | 0% | Execution gap identified |
| 9 | 5 | 3 | 60% | Recovered |
| 10 | 6 | 4 | 67% | Good velocity |
| 11 | 6 | 0 | 0% | Execution gap recurred |
| 12 | 6 | TBD | TBD | Focus on execution |

---

## Retrospective

### What Worked Well
- Governance loop (Auditor → Strategist → Curator) completed successfully
- Task quality is high (avg 8.2/10)
- Clear prioritization with P0 blocker identified
- Strategist correctly identified execution gap as #1 problem

### What Needs Improvement
- **Execution gap is critical** - 2 cycles with 0 tasks completed
- Tasks distributed but not picked up by agents
- Need clearer handoff to trigger agent activation

### Action Items for Next Cycle
1. **EXECUTE T0 IMMEDIATELY** - This is blocking everything
2. Monitor agent pickup of distributed tasks
3. Consider reducing cycle overhead if execution continues to lag

## Vision Alignment Check

| Principle | Tasks Aligned | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Export-First | 6/6 | All tasks serve exportable product |
| Zero Lock-In | 6/6 | OAuth + deploy docs enable independence |
| Cursor-Native | 6/6 | All prompts optimized for Claude/Cursor |
| Transparency | 6/6 | Clear success criteria in each task |
| Fail Gracefully | 5/6 | T2 notes env var fallback |

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled Start**: ~2025-12-25 20:00 (6 hours)
**Trigger**: Auditor reads new commits and test results

### Carry-Forward Items
- All 6 tasks if not completed

### Watch Items
- Execution gap - are agents picking up tasks?
- Uncommitted files - must be resolved
- Test stability - currently 732 passing
