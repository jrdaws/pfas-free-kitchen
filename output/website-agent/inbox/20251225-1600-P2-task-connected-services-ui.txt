## Context

The backend routes for connected services are complete (Supabase OAuth integration). Now we need a UI to display connected services status and allow users to manage their connections. This is part of the 5DS Clone Phase 7 work.

---

## Objectives

1. Create a Connected Services display component
2. Show connection status for each service (Supabase, GitHub, etc.)
3. Add connect/disconnect buttons
4. Integrate with existing sidebar or settings area

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Connected services component displays current connection status
- [ ] Users can initiate OAuth flow for unconnected services
- [ ] Users can disconnect connected services
- [ ] Component integrates with existing UI patterns
- [ ] No console errors or warnings

---

## Files to Create/Modify

### Create
- `website/components/configurator/ConnectedServices.tsx` - Main component

### Modify
- `website/app/components/configurator/sections/SettingsSection.tsx` - Add connected services display
- OR integrate into existing sidebar section

### Reference
- `website/app/api/auth/supabase/route.ts` - OAuth initiation
- `website/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` - OAuth callback
- `website/app/api/connected-services/route.ts` - Status API

---

## API Endpoints Available

- `GET /api/connected-services` - List connected services for user
- `POST /api/auth/supabase` - Initiate Supabase OAuth
- `DELETE /api/connected-services/[provider]` - Disconnect service

---

## UI Considerations

1. Match existing dark theme styling
2. Use appropriate icons for each service
3. Show connection timestamp if available
4. Clear feedback on connect/disconnect actions
5. Handle loading and error states

---

## Handoff

1. Move task file to done/
2. Write completion report to outbox/
3. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
4. Testing Agent may want to add tests for this UI

---

## Activation Prompt

```
Execute P2 task: Create a Connected Services UI component that shows OAuth connection status for Supabase and other services. Integrate with the configurator sidebar or settings area. Use existing API endpoints at /api/connected-services.
