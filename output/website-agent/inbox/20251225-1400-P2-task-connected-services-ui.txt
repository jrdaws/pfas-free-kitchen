# Task: Connected Services UI

Priority: **P2 (Medium)**
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: T0 (Commit), T2 (OAuth E2E)
Estimated Effort: High (2-3 hours)
Cycle: 12
Quality Score: 7.8/10

---

## Context

Cycle 10 completed the backend for connected services (OAuth routes, database schema). Now need to build the frontend components to allow users to connect external accounts (GitHub, Vercel, etc.).

---

## Objectives

1. Create ConnectedServicesPanel component in accordion sidebar
2. Add UI to show connected accounts status
3. Implement connect/disconnect buttons
4. Wire to existing API routes

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] ConnectedServicesPanel component created
- [ ] Shows list of available services (GitHub, Vercel, Supabase)
- [ ] Connect button initiates OAuth flow
- [ ] Disconnect button calls API and updates UI
- [ ] Component integrated in accordion sidebar

---

## Files to Create/Modify

- website/components/configurator/ConnectedServicesPanel.tsx (new)
- website/app/components/configurator/sections/ (update to include panel)
- website/lib/api.ts (add connected services hooks if needed)

---

## API Routes (already exist)

- GET /api/auth/connected-services - List connected services
- POST /api/auth/connect/[provider] - Initiate OAuth
- DELETE /api/auth/disconnect/[provider] - Remove connection

---

## Design Reference

Follow existing accordion section patterns:
- `website/app/components/configurator/sections/SupabaseSetup.tsx`
- Use same styling, icons, and layout patterns

---

## Handoff

1. Move task to done/
2. Report completion to outbox/
3. Integration Agent can test full OAuth flow
4. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
