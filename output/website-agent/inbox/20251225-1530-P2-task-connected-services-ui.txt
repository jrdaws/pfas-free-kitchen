# Task: Connected Services UI

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Cycle: 13
Quality Score: 8.0/10
Depends On: T0 (Commit Work) - but can start independently
Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours

---

## Context

Platform Agent completed backend for connected services:
- OAuth routes: `website/app/api/oauth/[provider]/route.ts`
- Connected services API: `website/app/api/connected-services/route.ts`
- Database schema: migrations for connected_services table

UI needed to display connected services status and allow connection/disconnection.

---

## Objectives

1. Create ConnectedServicesPanel component
2. Display connected service status (GitHub, Google, Vercel)
3. Add connect button that initiates OAuth flow
4. Add disconnect functionality that calls API
5. Integrate into AccordionSidebar settings section

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] ConnectedServicesPanel.tsx component created
- [ ] Shows status for each OAuth provider (connected/not connected)
- [ ] Connect button works and redirects to OAuth
- [ ] Disconnect button works and calls API
- [ ] Integrated into AccordionSidebar
- [ ] Responsive on mobile
- [ ] Matches existing UI style (dark theme, Indigo accents)

---

## Files to Create/Modify

New:
- `website/components/configurator/ConnectedServicesPanel.tsx`

Modify:
- `website/app/components/configurator/AccordionSidebar.tsx` (add panel to settings section)

---

## API Routes (Already Exist)

```
GET  /api/connected-services     → List connected services
POST /api/oauth/[provider]       → Initiate OAuth flow
DELETE /api/connected-services/[id] → Disconnect service
```

---

## Design Notes

- Use dark theme (#0A0A0A background, white text)
- Connected status: green indicator
- Not connected: gray indicator with "Connect" button
- Disconnect: red text button with confirmation
- Icons: GitHub, Google, Vercel (or generic cloud icon)

---

## Handoff

1. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md with component details
2. Run npm test (ensure no regressions)
3. Report: "T2 COMPLETE - Connected Services UI ready"
4. Testing Agent can validate OAuth flow in T3
