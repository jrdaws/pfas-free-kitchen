## BUG DESCRIPTION

Hydration error detected in the configurator preview:

```
In HTML, <div> cannot be a descendant of <p>.
This will cause a hydration error.
```

**Location**: `components/ui/badge.tsx` line 36
**Trigger**: Viewing Component Preview with Badge elements

## SCREENSHOT REFERENCE

The error shows:
- Badge component using `<div>` inside a parent `<p>` element
- This violates HTML nesting rules
- Causes React hydration mismatch

## FIX REQUIRED

1. Open `website/components/ui/badge.tsx`
2. Find the Badge component (line ~36)
3. Either:
   - Change Badge to render as `<span>` instead of `<div>`
   - Or change the parent element from `<p>` to `<div>`

## VERIFICATION

After fix:
1. Run `npm run dev` in website/
2. Navigate to AI Preview step
3. Confirm no hydration errors in console
4. Confirm badges render correctly

## HANDOFF

After fixing, run tests and commit.
