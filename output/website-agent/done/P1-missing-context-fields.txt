# P1: Missing Context Fields in Export

**Priority**: P1 - HIGH
**Date**: 2025-12-24
**From**: Quality Agent

---

## Problem Statement

The Context Fields step collects 3 pieces of information, but only 2 are saved to the 
exported project. Additionally, the Inspiration step data is not saved at all.

---

## Current Behavior

### Context Fields Step Collects:
1. Vision Statement - "What is the long-term vision for this project?"
2. Mission Statement - "What problem are you solving and for whom?"
3. Success Criteria - "How will you measure success?"

### What Gets Saved to .dd/:
- ✅ `.dd/vision.md` - Vision Statement saved
- ✅ `.dd/goals.md` - Success Criteria saved
- ❌ `.dd/mission.md` - **MISSING** - Mission Statement NOT saved

### Inspiration Step Collects:
1. Text description - "What features and functionality do you want?"
2. Uploaded images
3. Pasted URLs (Dribbble, Figma, websites)

### What Gets Saved:
- ❌ Nothing from Inspiration step is saved to .dd/

---

## Evidence from Downloaded Project

```
.dd/
├── goals.md              # Contains success criteria ✅
├── template-manifest.json # Template + integrations ✅
└── vision.md             # Contains vision statement ✅
```

Missing:
- `.dd/mission.md`
- `.dd/inspiration.md` or `.dd/inspiration/`

---

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Mission Statement Export

Create `.dd/mission.md` in the ZIP:

```markdown
# Mission Statement

[User's mission statement from Context Fields]

---

```

### Fix 2: Add Inspiration Export

Create `.dd/inspiration.md`:

```markdown
# Project Inspiration

## Description
[User's text description from "What features and functionality do you want?"]

## Reference URLs
- [URL 1]
- [URL 2]

## Uploaded Images
- inspiration-1.png (see .dd/inspiration-images/)
- inspiration-2.jpg

---
*Generated by dawson-does-framework configurator*
```

For uploaded images, create `.dd/inspiration-images/` directory.

### Fix 3: Update Export API

The export endpoint needs to:
1. Accept mission statement from configurator state
2. Accept inspiration data (text, URLs, images)
3. Generate the appropriate .dd/ files

---

## Files to Fix

1. Export API endpoint - add mission + inspiration handling
2. Configurator state - ensure these fields are passed to export
3. ZIP generator - add new files to archive

---

## Why This Matters

The .dd/ folder is meant to provide context for future AI collaboration:
> "These will be included in .dd/ handoff files for future AI collaboration"

Without mission and inspiration, AI agents lose critical context about:
- What problem the project solves
- Who the target users are
- What the user wants the project to look like
- Reference designs and inspirations

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Mission Statement saved to `.dd/mission.md`
- [ ] Inspiration description saved to `.dd/inspiration.md`
- [ ] Inspiration URLs listed in `.dd/inspiration.md`
- [ ] Uploaded inspiration images saved to `.dd/inspiration-images/`
- [ ] All .dd/ files included in ZIP export
