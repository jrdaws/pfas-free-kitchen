## USER FEEDBACK

"I don't think this worked, or at least it didn't work intuitively."

Screenshot shows Section Reorder panel with:
- Active Sections list (Nav, FAQ, PricingTable, Hero, etc.)
- Up/down arrows
- Remove (x) buttons

## CURRENT ISSUES

1. **Not clear it's drag-to-reorder** - User didn't realize they could drag
2. **Order looks wrong** - FAQ above Hero doesn't make sense as default
3. **No visual feedback** - Hard to see what's being moved
4. **No preview update** - Changes may not reflect in preview immediately

## SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Add Drag Handles
```tsx
// Add visible drag handle icon
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <GripVertical className="text-muted-foreground cursor-grab" />
  <span>{section.name}</span>
</div>
```

### 2. Add Drag Visual Feedback
- Highlight item being dragged
- Show drop zone indicator
- Animate reorder transition

### 3. Fix Default Order
Logical order should be:
1. Nav (required, always top)
2. Hero (required)
3. FeatureCards (required)
4. PricingTable
5. Testimonials
6. FAQ
7. CTA (required)
8. Footer (required, always bottom)

### 4. Add Instructions
```tsx
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mb-4">
  Drag sections to reorder. Required sections cannot be removed.
</p>
```

### 5. Live Preview Update
When sections reorder, the preview should update immediately.

## VERIFICATION

1. User can clearly see how to reorder
2. Dragging works smoothly
3. Preview updates in real-time
4. Default order makes logical sense
