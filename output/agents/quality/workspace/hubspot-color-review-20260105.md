# HubSpot-Adapted Color Scheme Review

**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Reviewer:** Quality Agent
**Status:** ⚠️ **SUPERSEDED**

---

## Executive Summary

The HubSpot-adapted color scheme assets were created on 2025-12-25 but have been **superseded** by subsequent design decisions. The website now uses a **Navy-first dual-theme system** (implemented 2025-12-26) rather than the white-background HubSpot style.

## Quality Assessment

| Orange and Navy balance | ✅ | Complementary warm/cool |
| Orange is primary | ✅ | #F97316 for CTAs |
| Navy adds depth | ✅ | #1E3A5F for secondary |
| No rogue colors | ✅ | No purple/teal |

### Contrast Ratios ✅

| Orange (#F97316) on White | ~3.4:1 | ⚠️ AA Large |

## Current Implementation Comparison

| Aspect | HubSpot Assets | Current Website |

| Default Theme | Light (white bg) | **Dark (Navy bg)** |
| Primary Color | #F97316 (Orange) | #F97316 (Orange) ✅ |
| Secondary | #1E3A5F (Navy) | Slate-800 |
| Background | #FFFFFF | #0F172A (Slate-900) |
| Approach | HubSpot-like clean | Developer-focused dark |

## Decision

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

The HubSpot-adapted scheme was **not applied** to the website because:

1. **Subsequent Design Decision:** On 2025-12-25/26, user selected Navy theme demos (`demo-2-navy-hero.html` and `demo-3-warm-sand.html`) as the source of truth.

2. **Navy as Default:** The website was updated to use Navy (#1E3A5F) as the **default dark theme**, with Warm Sand as the light theme.

3. **Current Implementation:** The website now uses a different color architecture:
   - `:root` = Dark/Navy theme (default)
   - `.light` = Warm Sand theme

### Assets Disposition

These assets remain valid as **design artifacts** and could be used if the project pivots to a light-first design:

- Keep in `output/shared/design/hubspot-adapted/` for reference
- Keep color swatches for documentation
- Do not apply to current website

---

## Recommendation

**CLOSE AS SUPERSEDED**

The HubSpot-adapted color scheme is well-designed but was superseded by the Navy dual-theme implementation. No further action required.

If the user wants to explore a light-first theme in the future, these assets provide a solid foundation.
