# Strategy Report

Cycle: 12
Date: 2025-12-25 12:00
Strategist: STRATEGIST Agent
Responding to: audit-20251225-0131.txt

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Execution gap persists. Cycle 11 completed governance loop (Auditor → Strategist → Curator) and distributed 6 tasks, but **ZERO** were executed. This mirrors the Cycle 8 pattern - governance overhead without work output.

**Strategy for Cycle 12**: EXECUTE, DON'T PLAN. Minimal new tasks. Focus on completing Cycle 11 pending work.

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Commit Uncommitted Work (P0)**: 14 files uncommitted for 2+ cycles. Risk of work loss. IMMEDIATE action required.
2. **Close Execution Gap (P1)**: Execute the 6 pending tasks from Cycle 11. No new planning until these are done.
3. **Validate New UI (P1)**: Accordion sidebar implemented but untested. UI bugs may go undetected.

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Depends On | Status |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| T0 | Commit Uncommitted Work | CLI | P0 | Low | None | **NEW - IMMEDIATE** |
| T1 | Complete Accordion UI Tests | Testing | P1 | Med | T0 | Cycle 11 - PENDING |
| T2 | Test Supabase OAuth E2E | Testing | P2 | Med | T0 | Cycle 11 - PENDING |
| T3 | Connected Services UI | Website | P2 | High | T0, T2 | Cycle 11 - PENDING |
| T4 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P3 | Low | None | Cycle 11 - PENDING |
| T5 | Create Deployment Guides | Documentation | P3 | Med | None | Cycle 11 - PENDING |

---

## Resource Allocation

### CLI Agent
- **T0**: Commit Uncommitted Work (P0 - IMMEDIATE)

### Testing Agent  
- **T1**: Complete Accordion UI Tests (P1)
- **T2**: Test Supabase OAuth E2E (P2)

### Website Agent
- **T3**: Connected Services UI (P2, after T2)

### Documentation Agent
- **T4**: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md (P3)
- **T5**: Create Deployment Guides (P3)

### Platform Agent
- No new tasks - available as backup

### Template Agent
- No new tasks - available as backup

### Integration Agent
- No new tasks - available as backup

## Dependencies Map

```
T0 (Commit) ─────┬──────────▶ T1 (UI Tests)
                 │
                 ├──────────▶ T2 (OAuth E2E)
                 │                    │
                 │                    ▼
                 └──────────▶ T3 (Services UI)

T4 (Coding Standards) ─────▶ (Independent)
T5 (Deploy Guides) ─────────▶ (Independent)
```

**Critical Path**: T0 → T1/T2 → T3

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Execution gap continues (no tasks picked up) | High | High | Reduce to 4 critical tasks only. Escalate in handoff. |
| Uncommitted work lost to git reset | Medium | High | T0 is P0 - must execute first |
| OAuth tests fail | Low | Medium | T2 validates before T3 builds on it |
| Agent overload | Low | Low | Max 2 tasks per agent enforced |

---

## Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Too Many Tasks**: Cycle 11 had 6 tasks, 0 executed. Reduce scope.
2. **Governance Without Execution**: PDCA stuck in Plan phase. Force Do phase.
3. **Documentation Debt Creep**: P3 items keep deferring. Bundle them.

---

## Draft Task Prompts

See: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/

### T0: Commit Uncommitted Work (NEW)

Priority: P0 (IMMEDIATE)
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)

### T1-T5: Use Existing Drafts

Cycle 11 Strategist already created prompts for T1-T5. These are still valid:
- T1: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/T2-accordion-ui-tests.txt
- T2: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/T4-supabase-oauth-e2e.txt
- T3: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/T3-connected-services-ui.txt
- T4: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/T5-coding-standards-doc.txt
- T5: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/T6-deployment-guides.txt

---

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT included this cycle:
- **Velocity Tracking Automation (P3)**: Deferred until execution gap closed
- **User Feedback Collection (P3)**: Deferred - need deployed product first
- **Chunked Code Generation (P3)**: Feature backlog, not urgent
- **UI Media Polish**: Media Agent completed icons; further polish deferred

---

## Success Metrics for Cycle 12

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Uncommitted files | 0 | `git status` shows clean |
| Tasks executed | ≥3 of 5 | Completion reports in outbox/ |
| Tests passing | 732+ | `npm test` |
| New test coverage | +20 lines | configurator-accordion.spec.ts |

---

## Recommended Execution Order

1. **FIRST**: CLI Agent commits work (T0) - unblocks everything
2. **PARALLEL**: Testing Agent runs T1 (UI tests) + T2 (OAuth E2E)
3. **AFTER T2**: Website Agent starts T3 (Connected Services UI)
4. **BACKGROUND**: Documentation Agent works T4/T5 independently

## Handoff

Report saved to: output/shared/reports/strategy-20251225-1200.txt
Draft prompts saved to: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/
Next agent: CURATOR

**CRITICAL MESSAGE TO CURATOR**: 
The execution gap is the #1 problem. Do NOT create new tasks. Distribute the existing tasks with urgency messaging. Consider triggering auto-continuation for T0.
