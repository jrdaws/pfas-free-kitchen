# Strategy Report - Cycle 16 (GOVERNANCE PAUSE CYCLE)

Cycle: 16
Date: 2025-12-25 16:30 NZDT
Strategist: STRATEGIST Agent
Responding to: audit-20251225-1201.txt

## ⚠️ GOVERNANCE PAUSE DIRECTIVE

This strategy cycle implements the Auditor's critical recommendation:

**STOP GOVERNANCE CYCLING. START EXECUTING.**

Cycles 11-15 have run governance agents while executor agents remained idle. This cycle prioritizes activating executors over continuing governance.

---

## Strategic Priorities

Based on Auditor's findings, this cycle focuses on:

1. **Clear Task Backlog**: Execute the 35+ pending tasks - governance without execution is waste
2. **Activate Testing Agent FIRST**: Accordion UI tests validate recent website work
3. **Unblock Website Agent**: Connected services UI is backend-ready and waiting

---

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Agent | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|----|------|-------|----------|--------|------------|
| T0 | Commit uncommitted work | CLI | P0 | Low | None |
| T1 | Accordion UI tests | Testing | P1 | Med | None |
| T2 | Connected services UI | Website | P2 | High | T1 (validation) |
| T3 | Supabase OAuth E2E tests | Testing | P2 | Med | None |
| T4 | Create CODING_STANDARDS.md | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |
| T5 | Create deployment guides | Documentation | P3 | Low | None |

---

## Resource Allocation

### CLI Agent
- T0: Commit uncommitted work (P0)
- Note: 1 file remaining (FRAMEWORK_MAP.md), quick 5-min task

### Testing Agent
- T1: Accordion UI tests (P1) - PRIMARY
- T3: Supabase OAuth E2E tests (P2) - SECONDARY

### Website Agent
- T2: Connected services UI (P2) - Backend routes ready in website/app/api/services/connected/

### Documentation Agent
- T4: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md (P3)
- T5: Create deployment guides (P3)

### Platform Agent
- No tasks this cycle (chunked generation deferred)

### Template Agent
- No tasks this cycle

### Integration Agent
- No tasks this cycle

## Dependencies Map

```
T0 (CLI: Commit) ─────────────────────────────▶ [Unblocks all]
        │
        ▼
T1 (Testing: Accordion) ──────────────────────▶ T2 (Website: Services UI)
        │
        └─────────────────────────────────────▶ T3 (Testing: OAuth E2E)

T4 (Docs: Standards) ──[parallel]──────────────▶ T5 (Docs: Deploy guides)
```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Executor agents not manually activated | High | Critical | Human must copy-paste prompts into new Cursor tabs |
| Accordion tests may need fixes | Medium | Low | Website Agent available for follow-up |
| Connected services UI scope creep | Low | Medium | Clear success criteria defined |
| Governance cycle restarts too soon | Medium | High | Next Auditor cycle delayed 12+ hours |

---

## Activation Sequence (HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED)

**Step 1**: Open new Cursor tab, paste CLI Agent prompt (T0)
**Step 2**: Open new Cursor tab, paste Testing Agent prompt (T1)
**Step 3**: After T1 completes, open Website Agent tab (T2)
**Step 4**: Documentation Agent can run in parallel (T4/T5)

## Draft Task Prompts

See individual files in: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/

| File | Agent | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| cycle16-T0-cli-commit.txt | CLI | P0 |
| cycle16-T1-testing-accordion.txt | Testing | P1 |
| cycle16-T2-website-services.txt | Website | P2 |
| cycle16-T3-testing-oauth.txt | Testing | P2 |
| cycle16-T4-docs-standards.txt | Documentation | P3 |
| cycle16-T5-docs-deploy.txt | Documentation | P3 |

---

## Deferred Items

Tasks explicitly NOT included this cycle:
- **Chunked code generation (Platform)**: P3, no immediate need
- **UI Media Polish (Media)**: Enhancement only, after core UI done
- **Velocity tracking automation (Platform)**: Nice-to-have metric

---

## Metrics Targets for This Cycle

| Metric | Current | Target | Success Criteria |
|--------|---------|--------|------------------|
| Executor tasks completed | 0 | 3+ | T0, T1, T2 done |
| Task backlog | 35+ | <25 | 10+ tasks cleared |
| Uncommitted files | 1 | 0 | All committed |
| Governance pause | No | Yes | No Auditor/Strategist/Curator for 12h |

## Handoff

Report saved to: output/shared/reports/strategy-20251225-1630.txt
Draft prompts saved to: output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/
Next agent: CURATOR (but recommend PAUSE - activate executors instead)

**RECOMMENDED**: Skip Curator, directly activate executor agents:
1. CLI Agent (5 min) → 2. Testing Agent (30 min) → 3. Website Agent (60 min)
