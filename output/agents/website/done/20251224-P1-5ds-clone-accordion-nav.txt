TASK: Accordion Navigation Sidebar
PRIORITY: P1
PHASE: 1.3 - Foundation
DEPENDENCIES: None (can start immediately)

---

Replace the current ConfiguratorSidebar with an accordion-style navigation matching the 5DaySprint design.

Requirements:
1. Create AccordionSidebar component with:
   - Collapsible sections for each major step
   - Icons matching screenshots (Research, Core Features, Integrate AI, Cursor, GitHub, Claude Code, Supabase, Vercel)
   - Active step highlighting with left border accent
   - Completion checkmarks for finished steps
   - Step descriptions visible when expanded
   
2. Sections should be:
   - Research: "Define your project vision"
   - Core Features: "Select features for your project"  
   - Integrate AI: "Add AI capabilities to your project"
   - Cursor: "Download & Install Cursor"
   - GitHub: "Create your GitHub repository"
   - Claude Code: "Install Claude Code CLI for AI assistance"
   - Supabase: "Configure your Supabase project"
   - Vercel: "Deploy your application"
   
3. Each section expands to show content inline (not navigate away)
4. Persist expanded state in localStorage
5. Style: Blue accent color (#0052FF), white background, subtle shadows

Reference: 5DaySprint screenshots showing accordion navigation
Replace: website/app/components/configurator/ConfiguratorSidebar.tsx

CONTEXT: This is part of a 28-task UI redesign to match the 5DaySprint platform design.

HANDOFF: When complete, this enables Phase 2 and Phase 3 tasks.
