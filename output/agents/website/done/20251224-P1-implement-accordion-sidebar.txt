TASK: Implement Accordion Sidebar - Phase 1 Core Layout
PRIORITY: P1 (Unblocks all UI alignment work)
TYPE: UI Implementation
DEPENDS_ON: output/shared/design/5DS_UI_SPECIFICATION.md

---

## Objective

Replace the current 64px icon-only sidebar with a 300px accordion sidebar matching the reference design. This is Phase 1 of the UI alignment project.

## Reference

Full specification: `output/shared/design/5DS_UI_SPECIFICATION.md`

## Current State

The current `ConfiguratorSidebar.tsx` is a narrow 64px icon-only navigation with tooltips. The reference design shows a wide accordion sidebar where:

1. Each section is an expandable accordion item
2. Form content appears INSIDE the expanded section
3. Sections show completion status (checkmarks, "Ready" badges)
4. Active section has a blue left border indicator

## Deliverables

### 1. Update AccordionSidebar.tsx

The component already exists at `website/app/components/configurator/AccordionSidebar.tsx` but needs updates:

- Width: Change from 80 (w-80 = 320px, close to target) - KEEP THIS
- Content: Instead of placeholder text, render actual section content
- Children prop: Use the existing `children` render prop pattern

### 2. Create Section Content Components

Create these in `website/app/components/configurator/sections/`:

```
sections/
├── ResearchSection.tsx      # Domain input, inspiration toggle, URLs
├── CoreFeaturesSection.tsx  # Feature category accordions (exists as CoreFeaturesSelector)
├── IntegrateAISection.tsx   # AI provider selection
├── CursorSection.tsx        # Guided setup for Cursor
├── GitHubSection.tsx        # GitHub repo creation steps
├── ClaudeCodeSection.tsx    # Claude Code CLI setup
├── SupabaseSection.tsx      # Supabase connection
├── VercelSection.tsx        # Vercel deployment
└── GenerateSection.tsx      # Final export/generate
```

### 3. Update configure/page.tsx

Change the layout from:
- Current: Sidebar (64px) + Main Content (flex-1)

To:
- New: Sidebar (300px) + Main Content (flex-1) + Optional Preview Card (320px)

The main content area should show:
- Project name/title at top
- FileTreeView when on Generate step
- Otherwise minimal content (most content is in sidebar)

### 4. Key Styling (from spec)

```css
/* Active section indicator */
.accordion-trigger.active::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 8px;
  bottom: 8px;
  width: 4px;
  background: #0052FF;
  border-radius: 0 4px 4px 0;
}

/* Section icon states */
.accordion-icon.pending { background: #F1F5F9; color: #94A3B8; }
.accordion-icon.active { background: #0052FF10; color: #0052FF; }
.accordion-icon.completed { background: #D1FAE5; color: #10B981; }
```

## Existing Code to Leverage

- `AccordionSidebar.tsx` - Already has the section structure, just needs content
- `CoreFeaturesSelector.tsx` - Feature selection logic, can be embedded
- `GuidedSetup.tsx` - Tool setup steps, adapt for individual sections
- `AIProviderPicker.tsx` / `ImageGenProviderPicker.tsx` - AI integration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sidebar width is ~300px on desktop
- [ ] Sections expand/collapse smoothly
- [ ] Active section shows blue left border
- [ ] Completed sections show green checkmark
- [ ] Form inputs work inside accordion content
- [ ] Progress is tracked across sections
- [ ] Mobile: Sidebar becomes slide-out drawer

## Notes

- Don't include any brand name references - just implement the design
- Keep the existing state management from `useConfiguratorStore`
- The sidebar should be the PRIMARY interaction area, not the main content
