# Task: Connected Services UI Frontend

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Quality Score: 8.4/10
Approved By: Curator Agent (Cycle 19)
Depends On: Human Commit (T1) - VERIFY first

## Context

Backend API routes for connected services already exist. Users need a dashboard UI to view and manage their connected integrations (Supabase, UploadThing). This demonstrates platform value and zero lock-in by showing which services are connected.

## Pre-Flight Check

Before starting, verify uncommitted work is committed:

```
git status --short | wc -l
```

If count > 0, wait for Human to complete T1 (commit task).

## Objectives

1. Create Connected Services dashboard page
2. Display integration status (connected/not connected)
3. Add connect/disconnect functionality
4. Apply Navy theme styling consistently (60-30-10 rule)
5. Ensure mobile responsive design

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard page at website/app/dashboard/services/page.tsx
- [ ] ConnectedServices component with status display
- [ ] Connect/disconnect actions functional
- [ ] Navy theme styling applied:
  - 60% Navy primary (#0A192F)
  - 30% Light backgrounds (#E6F1FF, #F8F8FF)
  - 10% Accent (cyan/gold)
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout
- [ ] Loading and error states handled

## Files to Create

- website/app/dashboard/services/page.tsx
- website/components/dashboard/ConnectedServices.tsx

## API Endpoints (Already Exist)

- GET /api/user/integrations - Fetch user's connected integrations
- POST /api/user/integrations - Connect new integration
- DELETE /api/user/integrations/[id] - Disconnect integration

## Design Reference

- Use Card component from website/components/ui/card.tsx
- Use Button component from website/components/ui/button.tsx
- Follow patterns in website/app/dashboard/ for layout
- Navy theme reference: output/shared/design/demos/

## Handoff

1. Test in local dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Verify Navy theme consistency with rest of dashboard
3. Commit: `feat(website): add connected services UI`
4. Move this task to output/agents/website/done/
5. Update prompts/agents/memory/WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
