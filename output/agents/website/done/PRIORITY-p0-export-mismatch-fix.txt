## Problem

The configurator shows a beautiful AI Preview with components, but the ZIP export contains only a basic starter structure. This causes user confusion and disappointment.

## Root Cause Analysis Needed

1. **AI Preview** shows full template with all components
2. **ZIP Export** only includes basic Next.js scaffold
3. **User Expectation**: ZIP matches preview
4. **Reality**: They don't match

## Tasks

1. Review `website/lib/zip-generator.ts` - what's actually exported?
2. Review `website/app/components/configurator/ExportView.tsx` - updated with clarity messaging (verify)
3. Determine if ZIP should include template components OR if messaging is sufficient
4. If ZIP should match preview:
   - Add template components to ZIP generation
   - Include page routes from templates
   - Add integration boilerplate

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Export produces what preview shows, OR
- [ ] Clear messaging explains the difference (already done in recent commits)
- [ ] No user confusion about ZIP vs CLI export
