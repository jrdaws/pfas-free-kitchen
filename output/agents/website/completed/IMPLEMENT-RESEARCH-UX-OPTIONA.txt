## Problem

Users are confused why Step 2 (Research) asks about "domain" when they just selected a template in Step 1. The placeholder text uses template names ("e.g., E-commerce, SaaS...") making it seem redundant.

---

## Task: Implement Option A (Quick Fix)

### File to Modify

`website/app/components/configurator/sections/ResearchSection.tsx`

### Changes Required

#### Change 1: Update the Label (line ~48)

```tsx
// FROM:
<Label htmlFor="domain" className="text-xs font-medium text-white/70">
  What domain is your project in?
</Label>

// TO:
<Label htmlFor="domain" className="text-xs font-medium text-white/70">
  Describe your specific niche
</Label>
```

#### Change 2: Update the Placeholder (line ~55)

```tsx
// FROM:
placeholder="e.g., E-commerce, SaaS..."

// TO:
placeholder="e.g., Pet food subscription, HR software for restaurants..."
```

#### Change 3: Add Hint Text (after the Input, around line ~58)

Add this line after the closing `/>` of the Input component:

```tsx
<p className="text-[10px] text-white/40 mt-1">
  Be specific! Better descriptions = better AI recommendations
</p>
```

## Verification

After making changes:

1. Run the dev server: `cd website && npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/configure
3. Click on "Research" section in sidebar
4. Verify:
   - [ ] Label says "Describe your specific niche"
   - [ ] Placeholder shows "e.g., Pet food subscription, HR software for restaurants..."
   - [ ] Hint text appears below the input

---

## After Completion

**IMPORTANT**: After implementing Option A, ask the user:

```
✅ Option A Complete!

Changes made:
- Updated label to "Describe your specific niche"
- Updated placeholder with specific examples
- Added hint text for better AI recommendations

Would you like me to continue with Option C (Smart Pre-fill)?

Option C will:
- Pre-fill the research field based on the template selected in Step 1
- Example: If user picks "SaaS", field shows "SaaS product for [describe your users and what problem you solve]"
- Requires changes to both ResearchSection.tsx and page.tsx

Reply with:
1. Yes, implement Option C
2. No, commit Option A only
```
