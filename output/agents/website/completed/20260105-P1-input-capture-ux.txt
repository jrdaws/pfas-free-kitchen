TASK: Enhanced User Input Capture UX
PRIORITY: P1 (Foundation)
TYPE: UX / Frontend / AI
AGENT: Website Agent

---

## Objective

Redesign how we capture user intent to maximize signal for AI generation.
Better inputs = better outputs.

## Current Problems

1. Vision field is a simple textarea - low engagement
2. Users don't know what to write
3. No structured extraction of requirements
4. Image/screenshot input underutilized
5. No guided discovery of needs

## Deliverables

### 1. Guided Vision Builder

Replace single textarea with guided experience:

```
Step 1: "What's the core problem you're solving?"
        [Text input with examples]
        
Step 2: "Who are your users?"
        [Persona selector: B2B | B2C | Internal | Mixed]
        [Optional: describe in detail]
        
Step 3: "What's your business model?"
        [Cards: Subscription | One-time | Freemium | Marketplace | Free]
        
Step 4: "What's your design vibe?"
        [Image grid: Minimal | Bold | Playful | Corporate | Dark]
        [Optional: upload inspiration images]
        
Step 5: "Any specific features you need?"
        [Smart checklist based on previous answers]
```

Each step updates a structured `VisionDocument`:

```typescript
interface VisionDocument {
  problem: string;
  audience: {
    type: 'b2b' | 'b2c' | 'internal' | 'mixed';
    description?: string;
  };
  businessModel: string;
  designStyle: string;
  inspirations: string[];  // URLs or uploaded images
  requiredFeatures: string[];
  niceToHaveFeatures: string[];
}
```

### 2. Smart Prompts & Examples

For each input, show:
- Placeholder with good example
- "Need help?" expands to show 3 examples
- AI suggestion based on template selection

Example:
```
Template: SaaS
Prompt: "What problem does your SaaS solve?"
Placeholder: "Help small businesses manage inventory without spreadsheets"
Examples:
  - "Automate social media scheduling for agencies"
  - "Track developer productivity metrics"
  - "Simplify contract signing for legal teams"
```

### 3. Voice Input Option

Add microphone button for voice-to-text:
- User describes vision verbally
- Transcribed to text
- AI structures into VisionDocument
- User reviews and edits

### 4. Inspiration Screenshot Analysis

When user uploads screenshots:
- AI analyzes visual style
- Extracts: colors, typography, layout patterns
- Auto-fills design preferences
- Shows "We detected: Modern, minimal, blue accent"

### 5. Progressive Disclosure

Don't overwhelm with all 23 steps upfront:
- Show 4 essential steps first
- "Advanced options" expands rest
- Smart defaults for skipped steps
- "AI will choose optimal settings"
