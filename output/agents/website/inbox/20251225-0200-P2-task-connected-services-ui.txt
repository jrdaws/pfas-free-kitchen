# Task: Connected Services UI

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: High (2-3 hours)
Quality Score: 7.8/10

## Context
Cycle 10 completed the backend for connected services (OAuth routes, database schema). Now need to build the frontend components to allow users to connect external accounts (GitHub, Vercel, etc.).

## Objectives
1. Create ConnectedServicesPanel component in accordion sidebar
2. Add UI to show connected accounts status
3. Implement connect/disconnect buttons
4. Wire to existing API routes

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ConnectedServicesPanel component created
- [ ] Shows list of available services (GitHub, Vercel, Supabase)
- [ ] Connect button initiates OAuth flow
- [ ] Disconnect button calls API and updates UI
- [ ] Component integrated in accordion sidebar

## Files to Modify
- website/components/configurator/ConnectedServicesPanel.tsx (new)
- website/app/components/configurator/sections/ (update to include panel)
- website/lib/api.ts (add connected services hooks if needed)

## API Routes (already exist)
- GET /api/auth/connected-services
- POST /api/auth/connect/[provider]
- DELETE /api/auth/disconnect/[provider]

## Reference Files
- src/platform/connected-services.ts (API implementation)
- website/components/configurator/SupabaseSetup.tsx (similar OAuth UI pattern)

## Design Notes
- Follow existing accordion section styling from FileTreeView.tsx
- Use indigo/violet gradient accents consistent with other panels
- Show connection status with green check / gray disconnected icons

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Report completion to outbox/
3. Integration Agent can test full OAuth flow
4. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
