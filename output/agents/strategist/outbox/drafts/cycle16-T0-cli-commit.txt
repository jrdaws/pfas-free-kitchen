# Task: Commit Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)

## Context

Audit Cycle 15 identified 1 uncommitted file (FRAMEWORK_MAP.md). This blocks visibility for all agents and must be resolved immediately.

## Objectives

1. Commit all pending changes
2. Push to origin/main
3. Verify clean working tree

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status` shows clean working tree
- [ ] Changes pushed to origin/main
- [ ] No uncommitted files remain

## Commands to Execute

```bash
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "chore: sync framework map"
git push origin main
```

## Files to Modify

- FRAMEWORK_MAP.md (commit only, no edits)

## Handoff

1. Verify tests still pass: `npm test`
2. End response with: "P0 commit complete. Workspace clean."
3. Update CLI_MEMORY.md if needed
