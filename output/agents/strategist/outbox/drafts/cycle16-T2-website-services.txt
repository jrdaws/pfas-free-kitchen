# Task: Connected Services UI

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Website Agent
Depends On: T1 (Accordion tests validate sidebar works)
Estimated Effort: High (60 minutes)

## Context

Backend routes for connected services are ready in `website/app/api/services/connected/`. The UI needs to display which services the user has connected (Supabase, UploadThing, etc.) and allow configuration.

## Objectives

1. Create UI component to display connected services status
2. Integrate with existing accordion sidebar sections
3. Show connection status (connected/not connected) for each service
4. Allow users to configure/disconnect services

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Connected services section visible in configurator
- [ ] Shows status for Supabase, UploadThing integrations
- [ ] Can trigger connection flow (OAuth for Supabase)
- [ ] Matches 5DS UI design aesthetic (dark theme, terminal-inspired)
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

## Files to Modify

- Create: `website/components/configurator/ConnectedServices.tsx`
- Modify: `website/app/components/configurator/FileTreeView.tsx` (add section)
- May reference: `website/app/api/services/connected/route.ts`

## Design Guidelines

Reference the 5DS UI specification:
- Dark theme (#0A0A0A background)
- Border colors: white/5 to indigo-500/30 on hover
- Status indicators: green for connected, gray for not connected
- Terminal-inspired aesthetic

## API Integration

The backend routes should already exist at:
- GET `/api/services/connected` - List connected services
- POST `/api/services/connected` - Add connection
- DELETE `/api/services/connected` - Remove connection

## Handoff

1. Run `npm test` and verify no regressions
2. Move task to done/
3. Write completion report to outbox/
4. Update WEBSITE_MEMORY.md
5. May trigger follow-up for OAuth flow testing (T3)
