# Task: Create Deployment Guides

Priority: P3
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None (can run parallel to T4)
Estimated Effort: Low (20 minutes)

## Context

Deployment documentation references vercel.md, netlify.md, and railway.md but these files don't exist. Users can't follow the documented deployment path.

## Objectives

1. Create `docs/deploy/vercel.md` - Primary deployment target
2. Create `docs/deploy/netlify.md` - Alternative deployment
3. Optionally create `docs/deploy/railway.md` - For backend services

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `docs/deploy/vercel.md` exists with step-by-step guide
- [ ] `docs/deploy/netlify.md` exists with step-by-step guide
- [ ] Each guide includes environment variable setup
- [ ] Guides reference the framework export process
- [ ] Dead links in existing docs are resolved

## Content for Vercel Guide

1. Prerequisites (Vercel account, GitHub connected)
2. Import project from GitHub
3. Configure Root Directory = `website` (for monorepo)
4. Set environment variables:
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - UPLOADTHING_TOKEN (if using storage)
   - REDIS_URL (if using caching)
5. Deploy and verify

## Content for Netlify Guide

1. Prerequisites
2. Import project
3. Build settings (next build, .next directory)
4. Environment variables
5. Deploy and verify

## Files to Create

- `docs/deploy/vercel.md`
- `docs/deploy/netlify.md`
- Optionally: `docs/deploy/railway.md`

## Handoff

1. Verify links work from other docs
2. Move task to done/
3. Write completion report to outbox/
4. Update DOCUMENTATION_MEMORY.md
