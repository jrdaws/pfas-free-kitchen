# Task: Commit Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (IMMEDIATE - DO FIRST)
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)
Cycle: 12

---

## Context

The Auditor has identified 14 uncommitted files that have persisted for 2+ cycles:
- 4 modified files
- 10 untracked files (governance reports, test files)

This is a CRITICAL hygiene issue. Work is at risk of loss. Git status shows dirty state. All other tasks are blocked until this is resolved.

---

## Objectives

1. Stage all modified and untracked files
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin main
4. Verify clean git status

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- [ ] Commit pushed to origin/main
- [ ] No files lost in process

---

## Files to Commit

Modified:
- output/shared/PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md
- output/shared/workspace/PROJECT_STATUS.md
- prompts/agents/memory/AUDITOR_MEMORY.md
- tests/integration-tests/uploadthing-e2e.test.mjs
- FRAMEWORK_MAP.md

- output/agents/strategist/outbox/drafts/*.txt
- output/shared/reports/strategy-*.txt
- output/shared/reports/audit-20251225-*.txt

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# Verify current state
git status

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-12 work (governance, tests, reports, UI specs)"

# Push to origin
git push origin main

# Verify clean state
git status
```

---

## Handoff

1. Verify commit appears in `git log --oneline -1`
2. Update CLI_MEMORY.md with completion note
3. Signal completion: "T0 COMPLETE - Git clean, ready for T1-T5"
4. Next: Testing Agent can start T1 (Accordion UI Tests)

---

## Blockers

None - this is the first task and unblocks all others.
