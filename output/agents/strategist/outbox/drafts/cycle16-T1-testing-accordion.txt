# Task: Accordion UI Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (30 minutes)

## Context

Website Agent implemented accordion sidebar in Phase 7 (5DS Clone). The spec file exists but needs completion and validation. This tests validates the new UI before Connected Services work begins.

## Objectives

1. Complete/fix accordion UI tests in `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`
2. Ensure all accordion sections expand/collapse correctly
3. Verify mobile responsive behavior
4. Run full test suite and confirm 732+ tests pass

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Accordion tests written and passing
- [ ] All existing 732 tests still pass
- [ ] No regressions in configurator UI
- [ ] Test file committed to repo

## Files to Modify

- `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts` (complete tests)
- May need to check: `website/app/components/configurator/FileTreeView.tsx`

## Test Scenarios to Cover

1. **Accordion open/close**: Click section header toggles content
2. **Only one section open**: Opening new section closes previous (if that's the pattern)
3. **Content renders**: Verify section content loads (e.g., SupabaseSetup)
4. **Mobile behavior**: Sidebar collapses to drawer on mobile

## Handoff

1. Run `npm test` and record results
2. Move task to done/
3. Write completion report to outbox/
4. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md
5. Signal Website Agent can proceed with T2
