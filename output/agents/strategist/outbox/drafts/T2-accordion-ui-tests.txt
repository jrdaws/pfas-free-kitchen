# Task: Complete Accordion UI Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: T1 (Commit Uncommitted Work)
Estimated Effort: Medium (1 hour)

## Context
The accordion sidebar was implemented in Cycle 10 but the Playwright test file (configurator-accordion.spec.ts) is incomplete. Need to finish tests and run them to validate the UI works across all viewport sizes.

## Objectives
1. Review existing configurator-accordion.spec.ts
2. Add tests for:
   - Accordion expand/collapse functionality
   - Section content rendering
   - Mobile sidebar accordion behavior
   - Keyboard navigation
3. Run tests and fix any failures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] configurator-accordion.spec.ts has 5+ test cases
- [ ] All tests pass on desktop viewport (1280x720)
- [ ] All tests pass on mobile viewport (375x667)
- [ ] Test results documented

## Files to Modify
- website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts

## Commands
cd website
npx playwright test configurator-accordion.spec.ts --project=chromium

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Report test results to outbox/
3. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md with test coverage notes
