## Progress Assessment

### Goals Met (This Cycle)
- [x] Supabase OAuth integration complete
- [x] Accordion sidebar with inline sections implemented
- [x] Clone command feature-assembler integration
- [x] Custom icons for sidebar sections and file tree
- [x] SupabaseSetup component integrated
- [x] Landing page updated for clone command
- [x] Mobile sidebar matches accordion pattern
- [x] Persistent state for tool status, domain, AI provider
- [x] UploadThing E2E tests added (370 lines)

### Goals In Progress
- [ ] 5DS Clone Phase 7 - Integration (accordion wired, needs testing)
- [ ] Connected services API (routes created, needs frontend)
- [ ] Project cards terminal style update

### Goals Not Started
- [ ] User feedback collection (P3)
- [ ] Velocity tracking automation (P3)

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (P1)
- None identified

### Important Gaps (P2)
1. **UI tests for configurator**: Accordion sidebar added but no Playwright tests yet
2. **Connected services frontend**: API routes exist, need UI to connect external accounts
3. **Uncommitted changes**: 2 files modified, 1 untracked (see below)

### Minor Gaps (P3)
1. **Missing deployment guides**: vercel.md, netlify.md, railway.md referenced but not created
2. **CODING_STANDARDS.md**: Referenced in agent context but doesn't exist

---

## Uncommitted Changes

| File | Status |
|------|--------|
| FRAMEWORK_MAP.md | Modified |
| tests/integration-tests/uploadthing-e2e.test.mjs | Modified |
| website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts | Untracked (new) |

**Recommendation**: Commit these changes before next cycle.

---

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Vercel env vars | Low | Human | Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SUPABASE_*, REDIS_* in dashboard |
| Vercel primary domain | Low | Human | Set Root Dir=website in project settings |

---

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

### Priority 1 (Must Do)
1. **Commit uncommitted work** - 2 modified files + 1 new test file
2. **Complete accordion sidebar testing** - The new configurator-accordion.spec.ts needs to be finished and run

### Priority 2 (Should Do)
1. **Add connected services UI** - Backend routes ready, need frontend components
2. **Test Supabase OAuth flow end-to-end** - Integration complete, needs user testing
3. **Run UI tests** - Verify accordion sidebar works on all viewport sizes

### Priority 3 (Could Do)
1. **Create missing deployment guides** - Documentation Agent
2. **Add velocity tracking** - Platform Agent can automate
