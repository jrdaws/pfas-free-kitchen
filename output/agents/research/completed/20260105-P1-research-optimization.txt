TASK: Optimize Research Phase for Better Output Quality
PRIORITY: P1 (High Impact)
TYPE: Research / AI / UX
AGENT: Research Agent

---

## Objective

Improve how the research phase captures, analyzes, and applies user intent
to generate more relevant and accurate project configurations.

## Current Problems

1. Research runs once, no iteration
2. URL extraction sometimes fails or returns shallow data
3. Recommendations aren't always applied correctly
4. No feedback loop - user can't refine results
5. Research context is lost after the step

## Deliverables

### 1. Multi-Source Research Input

Design a system that accepts:
- **Text description** (current)
- **Image uploads** (screenshots of inspiration sites)
- **URL deep-crawling** (not just homepage)
- **Figma/design file links** (extract design tokens)
- **Competitor analysis** (multiple URLs compared)

Output: Research input specification document

### 2. Iterative Research Refinement

Design UX flow for:
- User sees initial recommendations
- User can say "more like X, less like Y"
- AI refines recommendations based on feedback
- 2-3 iteration cycles before finalizing

Output: UX wireframes and API spec

### 3. Research Context Persistence

Design how research insights carry through:
- Store in Zustand state AND database
- Pass to preview generation
- Include in export README
- Use for component prop generation

Output: Data flow diagram

### 4. Competitive Analysis Feature

When user provides competitor URLs:
- Extract their features
- Identify differentiation opportunities
- Suggest unique selling points
- Map to available integrations

Output: Feature specification

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Research inputs documented
- [ ] Iteration UX designed
- [ ] Context persistence designed
- [ ] Competitive analysis specified
- [ ] Ready for Platform Agent implementation
