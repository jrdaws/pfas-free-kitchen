4. Document required environment variables for each platform

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 3 deployment guides created
- [ ] Each guide has step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Required env vars documented per platform
- [ ] Links from other docs work
- [ ] Follows export-first philosophy (no vendor lock-in)

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Vercel
- Native Next.js support
- Edge functions work out of box
- Set `Root Directory: website`

### Netlify
- Next.js plugin required
- May need adapter config
- Serverless functions in `netlify/functions/`

### Railway
- Docker-based deployment
- Good for monorepo
- Redis add-on available

---

## Source Material

Reference these for platform-specific details:
- `output/agents/platform/outbox/` (deployment reports)
- `website/vercel.json` (if exists)
- `website/next.config.ts`
- Vercel dashboard experience from Platform Agent

---

## Handoff

1. Move task to `output/agents/documentation/done/`
2. Update DOCUMENTATION_MEMORY.md
3. Update any referencing docs if needed
4. No follow-up unless issues found
