# Task: Create Vercel Deployment Execution Guide

**Priority:** P2 (Medium)
**Assigned To:** Documentation Agent
**Created:** 2025-12-23 19:00
**Quality Score:** 8.6/10

---

## Context

All deployment preparation is complete:
- `website/vercel.json` configured with headers, regions, function timeouts
- `website/.env.example` documents all environment variables
- `docs/deploy/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` has comprehensive setup guide

The human needs a **concise, step-by-step checklist** to execute the actual deployment. This should be a single-page, actionable document.

## Vision Alignment

- **Export-First**: Ensures platform can be deployed for user access
- **Transparency**: Clear, explicit deployment steps
- **Fail Gracefully**: Includes rollback procedures

## Objectives

1. Create actionable deployment checklist (numbered steps)
2. Include complete environment variable list with sources
3. Document post-deployment verification steps
4. Include rollback procedure
5. Estimate time to complete

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Step-by-step checklist created (numbered, actionable)
- [ ] All required environment variables listed with where to get them
- [ ] Verification commands documented (curl, smoke tests)
- [ ] Rollback procedure included (single-command rollback)
- [ ] Estimated time to complete noted (e.g., "~15 minutes")

## Reference Files

```bash
# Review existing documentation
cat website/vercel.json
cat website/.env.example
cat docs/deploy/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md | head -100
