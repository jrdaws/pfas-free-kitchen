## Context

Deployment documentation references vercel.md, netlify.md, and railway.md but these files don't exist. Users can't follow the documented deployment path.

## Objectives

1. Create `docs/deploy/vercel.md` - Primary deployment target
2. Create `docs/deploy/netlify.md` - Alternative deployment
3. Optionally create `docs/deploy/railway.md` - For backend services

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `docs/deploy/vercel.md` exists with step-by-step guide
- [ ] `docs/deploy/netlify.md` exists with step-by-step guide
- [ ] Each guide includes environment variable setup
- [ ] Guides reference the framework export process
- [ ] Dead links in existing docs are resolved

5. Deploy and verify

## Content for Netlify Guide

1. Prerequisites
2. Import project
3. Build settings (next build, .next directory)
