## Context

Multiple governance documents reference `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md` but it doesn't exist. This creates dead links and incomplete onboarding for new agents.

## Objectives

1. Create the missing CODING_STANDARDS.md file
2. Document existing code style conventions already in use
3. Include both .mjs (CLI) and .ts (website) standards
4. Reference from AGENT_CONTEXT.md

## Success Criteria

- [ ] File exists at `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] Documents semicolon rules (.mjs vs .ts)
- [ ] Documents indentation (2 spaces)
- [ ] Documents naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- [ ] Documents import/export patterns
- [ ] Includes examples from existing code

## Content to Include

1. **Language Standards**
   - JavaScript (.mjs): No semicolons, 2-space indent
   - TypeScript (.ts/.tsx): Semicolons, 2-space indent

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Functions/variables: camelCase
   - Components/classes: PascalCase
   - Files: kebab-case for docs, camelCase for code

3. **Import Patterns**
   - Prefer named exports
   - Group imports: external → internal → relative

4. **Error Handling**
   - Use recovery guidance pattern
   - Reference `src/dd/recovery-guidance.mjs`

## Files to Create

- `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`

## Handoff

1. Verify file renders correctly
2. Move this task to done/
3. Write completion report to outbox/
4. Update DOCUMENTATION_MEMORY.md

---

## Quick Start Prompt

```
Read prompts/agents/roles/DOCUMENTATION.md and execute task T4 from Cycle 16 strategy.
Create docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md documenting the code style conventions.
Reference existing code in src/dd/ and website/ for examples. Include both .mjs and .ts standards.
```
