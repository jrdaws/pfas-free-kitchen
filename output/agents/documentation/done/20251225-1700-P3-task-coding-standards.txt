Priority: P3
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (30 minutes)
Cycle: 14 (Curated)
Quality Score: 8.2/10

---

## Context

`CODING_STANDARDS.md` is referenced in AGENT_CONTEXT.md and .cursorrules but the file doesn't exist at `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`. This creates dead links and missing guidance for agents.

---

## Objectives

1. Create `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
2. Document existing conventions from AGENT_CONTEXT.md
3. Add examples for each language (JavaScript ESM / TypeScript)
4. Include naming conventions and import ordering

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md` exists
- [ ] Documents semicolon rules (no semicolons in .mjs, semicolons in .ts)
- [ ] Documents indent style (2-space)
- [ ] Includes naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- [ ] Has code examples for both JS and TS
- [ ] Link from AGENT_CONTEXT.md works

---

## File to Create

- `docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
