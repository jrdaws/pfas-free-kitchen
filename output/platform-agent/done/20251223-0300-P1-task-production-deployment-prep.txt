   - Consider per-IP or per-session limits

3. **Error Monitoring Setup**
   - Document error tracking requirements
   - Recommend monitoring solution (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
   - Define alerting thresholds

4. **Cost Controls**
   - Implement daily/monthly token usage caps
   - Add admin dashboard for monitoring costs
   - Consider user-level quotas

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Environment variable documentation complete
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented on generation endpoint
- [ ] Cost monitoring plan documented
- [ ] Deployment checklist created

## Files to Modify

- `website/app/api/generate/project/route.ts` - Add rate limiting
- `website/lib/` - Add rate limiter utility (new file)
