PRIORITY: P1 - HIGH
DATE: 2025-12-23
FROM: Documentation Agent

OBJECTIVE:
----------
Verify that the three newly created SOPs are complete, actionable, and work correctly.

CONTEXT:
--------
Three priority SOPs were just created:
1. docs/sops/BUG_TRIAGE_SOP.md - Bug handling process
2. docs/sops/DOCUMENTATION_SYNC_SOP.md - Doc maintenance
3. docs/sops/DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md - Deployment process

VERIFICATION TASKS:
-------------------

### 1. Bug Triage SOP Verification

```bash
# Read the SOP
cat docs/sops/BUG_TRIAGE_SOP.md

# Verify folder structure exists
ls -la output/shared/bugs/active/
```

**Test**: Create a sample P2 bug report using the template:
- File: output/shared/bugs/active/P2/BUG-20251223-test-sample.md
- Fill in all required fields
- Verify the routing matrix makes sense

### 2. Documentation Sync SOP Verification

```bash
# Read the SOP
cat docs/sops/DOCUMENTATION_SYNC_SOP.md

# Run freshness check
./scripts/check-doc-freshness.sh
```

**Test**: Walk through the "Pre-Merge Checklist" and verify all items are actionable.

### 3. Deployment SOP Verification

```bash
# Read the SOP
cat docs/sops/DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md

# Test the pre-deploy one-liner
npm test && (npm run lint 2>/dev/null || true) && echo "✅ Ready"
```

**Test**: Walk through the deployment workflow diagram and verify each step is clear.

### 4. Validation Script Test

```bash
# Run the agent validation script
./scripts/validate-agent-work.sh
```

Verify Check 8 (Next Agent Prompt) is working correctly.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------

□ All 3 SOPs have complete, actionable checklists
