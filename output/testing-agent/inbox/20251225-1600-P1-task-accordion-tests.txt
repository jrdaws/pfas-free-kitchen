Priority: P1 (High)
Assigned To: Testing Agent

Estimated Effort: Medium (30-45 minutes)

## Context

The accordion sidebar UI was implemented in Cycle 10-11 with mobile support and inline sections. A test file was started but is incomplete: `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`. This test needs to be completed to validate the UI works correctly.

The accordion sidebar is a key UX component for the configurator, so ensuring it works reliably is important.

---

## Objectives

1. Review existing test file: `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`
2. Complete tests for accordion expand/collapse behavior
3. Add tests for mobile sidebar accordion
4. Verify section content renders correctly
5. Run tests and ensure all pass

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All accordion expand/collapse tests pass
- [ ] Mobile sidebar tests pass
- [ ] Section content rendering tests pass
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests
- [ ] Test count increases from 732 baseline

---

## Files to Modify

- `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts` - Complete this test file

## Files to Reference

- `website/app/components/configurator/AccordionSidebar.tsx` - Main component
- `website/app/components/configurator/MobileSidebar.tsx` - Mobile version
- `website/app/components/configurator/sections/*.tsx` - Section components

---

## Test Cases to Cover

1. **Accordion Expand/Collapse**
   - Clicking section header expands section
   - Clicking expanded section collapses it
   - Only one section can be expanded at a time (if accordion mode)

2. **Mobile Sidebar**
   - Hamburger menu opens sidebar
   - Sections work in mobile view
   - Closing sidebar resets state

3. **Section Content**
   - SupabaseSetup section renders form
   - Other sections render appropriate content
   - Error states handled gracefully

---

## Handoff

1. Move task file to done/
2. Write test completion report to outbox/
3. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md with new test count
4. Note any issues found during testing

---

## Activation Prompt

```
Execute P1 task: Complete the accordion UI tests in website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts. Ensure accordion expand/collapse, mobile sidebar, and section content rendering are all tested. Run tests and verify all pass.
