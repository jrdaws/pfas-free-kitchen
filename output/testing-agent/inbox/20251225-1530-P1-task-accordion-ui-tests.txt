# Task: Complete Accordion UI Tests

Priority: P1
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Cycle: 13
Quality Score: 8.4/10
Depends On: T0 (Commit Work) - but can start independently
Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours

---

## Context

Accordion sidebar was implemented in Phase 7:
- Component: `website/app/components/configurator/AccordionSidebar.tsx`
- Mobile version: `website/app/components/configurator/MobileSidebar.tsx`
- Test file exists but incomplete: `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`

The accordion UI needs Playwright test coverage to prevent regressions.

---

## Objectives

1. Complete Playwright tests for accordion sidebar
2. Test all section expansions/collapses
3. Test mobile accordion behavior at 375px viewport
4. Verify persistence of expansion state
5. Test keyboard navigation (Enter/Space to toggle)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] configurator-accordion.spec.ts has 5+ test cases
- [ ] Tests cover: section toggle, multi-section, mobile, persistence
- [ ] All tests pass on desktop viewport (1280x720)
- [ ] All tests pass on mobile viewport (375x667)
- [ ] No regressions in existing 732 tests
- [ ] npm test passes

---

## Files to Modify

- `website/tests/configurator-accordion.spec.ts`

---

## Test Cases to Include

1. **Section Toggle**: Click section header → content expands/collapses
2. **Multiple Sections**: Only one section expanded at a time (or multiple allowed?)
3. **Mobile Behavior**: Accordion works in mobile viewport
4. **Persistence**: Expanded sections remember state on reload
5. **Keyboard**: Enter/Space keys toggle sections
6. **Initial State**: First section expanded by default

---

## Commands

```bash
cd website
npx playwright test configurator-accordion.spec.ts --project=chromium
npm test
```

---

## Handoff

1. Run `npm test` and confirm 732+ tests pass
2. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md with test coverage notes
3. Report: "T1 COMPLETE - Accordion UI tests passing"
