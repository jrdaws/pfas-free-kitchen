# Task: Add Configurator UI Tests

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Testing Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~1 hour)

Quality Score: 9.2/10

## Context
The Auditor identified a coverage gap: the configurator component lacks UI tests.
This is the core user-facing feature and needs E2E test coverage.

## Objectives
1. Create Playwright tests for configurator flow
2. Test step navigation (1→2→3→4)
3. Test template selection
4. Test integration toggle
5. Test export modal

## Success Criteria
- [ ] website/tests/configurator.spec.ts exists
- [ ] Tests all 4 configurator steps
- [ ] Tests template selection functionality
- [ ] Tests export options (CLI, ZIP)
- [ ] All tests pass: npm run test:e2e
- [ ] CI includes these tests

## Files to Create/Modify
- website/tests/configurator.spec.ts (create)
- website/playwright.config.ts (verify includes new test)

## Commands
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework/website
npm run dev &
npx playwright test tests/configurator.spec.ts

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "test(website): add configurator E2E tests"
3. Update TESTING_MEMORY.md with coverage notes
