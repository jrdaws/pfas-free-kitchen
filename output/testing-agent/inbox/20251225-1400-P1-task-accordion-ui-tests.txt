## Context

The accordion sidebar was implemented in Cycle 10 but the Playwright test file (configurator-accordion.spec.ts) is incomplete. Need to finish tests and run them to validate the UI works across all viewport sizes.

## Objectives

1. Review existing configurator-accordion.spec.ts
2. Add tests for:
   - Accordion expand/collapse functionality
   - Section content rendering
   - Mobile sidebar accordion behavior
   - Keyboard navigation (a11y)
3. Run tests and fix any failures

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] configurator-accordion.spec.ts has 5+ test cases
- [ ] All tests pass on desktop viewport (1280x720)
- [ ] All tests pass on mobile viewport (375x667)
- [ ] Test results documented
