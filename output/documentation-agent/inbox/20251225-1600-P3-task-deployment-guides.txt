# Task: Create Deployment Guides

Priority: P3 (Low)
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (1 hour)
Cycle: 14
Created: 2025-12-25 16:00

## Context

The deployment documentation references several guides that don't exist:
- `docs/deploy/vercel.md`
- `docs/deploy/netlify.md`
- `docs/deploy/railway.md`

These are dead links and should be created to complete the deployment documentation.

---

## Objectives

1. Create `docs/deploy/vercel.md` - Vercel deployment guide
2. Create `docs/deploy/netlify.md` - Netlify deployment guide
3. Create `docs/deploy/railway.md` - Railway deployment guide

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All three deployment guides exist
- [ ] Each guide includes step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Environment variables documented for each platform
- [ ] Common issues and troubleshooting included
- [ ] Links from parent docs work correctly

---

## Files to Create

- `docs/deploy/vercel.md`
- `docs/deploy/netlify.md`
- `docs/deploy/railway.md`

## Files to Reference

- `docs/deploy/` - Existing deployment docs
- `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Main guide
- `.env.example` - Environment variables needed
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration (if exists)

---

## Content Structure for Each Guide
