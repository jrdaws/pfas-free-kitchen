3. Include naming conventions, formatting, imports
4. Reference existing patterns from codebase

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md exists
- [ ] Covers: semicolons, indentation, naming, imports
- [ ] Consistent with existing .cursorrules and AGENT_CONTEXT.md content
- [ ] No duplicate info - reference other docs where appropriate
- [ ] Includes code examples for each language
