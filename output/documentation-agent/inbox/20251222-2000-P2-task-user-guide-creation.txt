## Task Description

Create a comprehensive Quick Start Guide for new users that covers the
end-to-end journey from first visit to running app.

## Context

The framework now has:
- Working CLI with export and pull commands
- Web configurator with AI generation

- Multiple templates with integrations

But no unified user guide that walks through the complete flow.

## Files to Create

- docs/guides/QUICK_START.md

## Files to Review

- README.md (current state)
- docs/cli/export.md
- docs/cli/pull.md
- website/app/configure/page.tsx (user flow)

## Guide Structure

```markdown

cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Option 2: Web Configurator (5 minutes)
1. Visit dawson.dev/configure
2. Choose template
3. Add integrations
4. Generate with AI
5. Download or pull

## Option 3: AI Description (10 minutes)
