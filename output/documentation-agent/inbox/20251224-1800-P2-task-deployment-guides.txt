# Task: Create Deployment Guides

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)
Curated By: CURATOR Agent
Quality Score: 9.2/10

## Context
Testing Agent found dead links to deployment guides (vercel.md, netlify.md, railway.md).
These need to be created to prevent 404s and help users deploy.

## Objectives
1. Create docs/deployment/vercel.md
2. Create docs/deployment/netlify.md
3. Create docs/deployment/railway.md
4. Link from docs/deployment/README.md

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All three deployment guides exist
- [ ] Each includes environment variable setup
- [ ] Each includes step-by-step deployment instructions
- [ ] No dead links in documentation
- [ ] Tested: all links work

## Files to Create
- docs/deployment/vercel.md
- docs/deployment/netlify.md
- docs/deployment/railway.md

## Reference
- Existing docs/deploy/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md (merge or consolidate)
- docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "docs(deployment): add Vercel, Netlify, Railway guides"
3. Update PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md (remove from backlog)
