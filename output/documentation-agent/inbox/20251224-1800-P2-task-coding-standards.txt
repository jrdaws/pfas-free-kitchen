# Task: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

Priority: P2
Assigned To: Documentation Agent

Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)
Curated By: CURATOR Agent
Quality Score: 9.4/10

## Context
The Auditor identified that docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md is referenced in multiple 
files but doesn't exist. This causes dead links and confusion for developers.

## Objectives

3. Include naming conventions, import ordering, error handling
4. Add good/bad code examples

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Covers semicolon rules (none in .mjs, required in .ts)
- [ ] Covers 2-space indentation
- [ ] Covers naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase)
- [ ] Includes practical code examples
- [ ] No dead links to this file

## Files to Create
- docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md

## Reference
- AGENT_CONTEXT.md (coding standards section)
- Existing code patterns in src/dd/*.mjs and website/*.ts

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "docs(standards): create CODING_STANDARDS.md"
3. Update PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md (remove from backlog)
