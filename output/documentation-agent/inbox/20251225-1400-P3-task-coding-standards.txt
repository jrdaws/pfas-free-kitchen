# Task: Create CODING_STANDARDS.md

Priority: **P3 (Low)**
Assigned To: Documentation Agent
Depends On: None (can run parallel)
Estimated Effort: Low (30 minutes)
Cycle: 12
Quality Score: 8.4/10

---

## Context

CODING_STANDARDS.md is referenced in AGENT_CONTEXT.md but doesn't exist. This creates dead links and missing guidance for agents.

---

## Objectives

1. Create docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md
2. Document existing conventions from AGENT_CONTEXT.md
3. Add examples for each language (JS/TS)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md exists
- [ ] Documents semicolon rules, indent style
- [ ] Includes naming conventions
- [ ] Has code examples
- [ ] Referenced files updated if needed

---

## Files to Create

- docs/standards/CODING_STANDARDS.md (new)

---

## Content Outline

1. **JavaScript (.mjs) Conventions**
   - No semicolons
   - 2-space indent
   - ES modules (import/export)

2. **TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) Conventions**
   - Semicolons required
   - 2-space indent
   - Strict mode

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - camelCase for functions/variables
   - PascalCase for components/classes
   - SCREAMING_SNAKE for constants

4. **Import Ordering**
   - Node built-ins first
   - External packages
   - Internal modules
   - Relative imports

5. **Error Handling Patterns**
   - Use recovery-guidance.mjs patterns
   - Fail gracefully with actionable messages

6. **Testing Conventions**
   - Test file naming: *.test.mjs or *.spec.ts
   - Describe blocks for grouping

---

## Source Material

- AGENT_CONTEXT.md (lines 65-73)
- Existing code patterns in src/dd/*.mjs
- Existing patterns in website/components/*.tsx

---

## Handoff

1. Move task to done/
2. Verify link from AGENT_CONTEXT.md works
3. Update DOCUMENTATION_MEMORY.md
