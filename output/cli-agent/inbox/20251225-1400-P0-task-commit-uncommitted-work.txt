# Task: Commit Uncommitted Work

Priority: **P0 (IMMEDIATE - DO FIRST)**
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)
Cycle: 12
Quality Score: 9.6/10

---

## ⚠️ URGENCY

This task is **2+ cycles overdue**. 14 uncommitted files are at risk of loss. This BLOCKS all other tasks. Execute IMMEDIATELY.

---

## Context

The Auditor has identified 14 uncommitted files that have persisted for 2+ cycles:
- 6 modified files
- 8+ untracked files (governance reports, test files)

This is a CRITICAL hygiene issue. Work is at risk of loss. Git status shows dirty state. All other tasks are blocked until this is resolved.

---

## Objectives

1. Stage all modified and untracked files
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin main
4. Verify clean git status

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- [ ] Commit pushed to origin/main
- [ ] No files lost in process

---

```

---

## Handoff

1. Verify commit appears in `git log --oneline -1`
2. Update CLI_MEMORY.md with completion note
3. Signal completion: "T0 COMPLETE - Git clean, ready for T1-T5"
4. Next: Testing Agent can start T1 (Accordion UI Tests)
