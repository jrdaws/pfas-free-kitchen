## PROBLEM

The web configurator shows a beautiful preview with:
- Nav component
- Hero section
- Feature cards
- Pricing table
- Testimonials
- FAQ accordion
- CTA section
- Footer

But the exported project only contains:

```tsx
<main style={{ padding: 24 }}>
  <h1>SaaS Template</h1>
  <p>Export succeeded...</p>
</main>
```

## USER EXPECTATION

"What you see is what you get" - the preview shows exactly what should be exported.

## REQUIRED CHANGES

### 1. Export Command Should Include Components

When user runs:
```bash
framework export saas ./mytestproject07 --auth supabase ...
```

The output should include:
```
mytestproject07/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx         # Full page with all sections
│   └── layout.tsx
├── components/
│   ├── Nav.tsx
│   ├── Hero.tsx
│   ├── FeatureCards.tsx
│   ├── PricingTable.tsx
│   ├── Testimonials.tsx
│   ├── FAQ.tsx
│   ├── CTA.tsx
│   └── Footer.tsx
├── integrations/        # Selected integrations
│   ├── auth/supabase/
│   ├── payments/stripe/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### 2. Copy Template Components

The components exist in:
- `templates/saas/components/` (if they exist)
- OR generate from `website/components/preview/` components

### 3. Include Selected Integrations

User selected: auth/supabase, payments/stripe, email/resend, db/supabase, ai/openai, analytics/posthog, storage/r2

These should be scaffolded in `integrations/` folder.

## INVESTIGATION

1. Check `bin/framework.js` export command logic
2. Check `src/commands/export.mjs` 
3. See what's in `templates/saas/` vs what gets copied
4. Check if there's a gap between web configurator selection and CLI export

## VERIFICATION

After fix:
1. Run full export with integrations
2. Verify components folder exists
3. Verify integrations folder exists
4. Run `npm run dev` in exported project
5. Confirm it matches the preview

## HANDOFF

This is the #1 gap between promise and delivery. Fix this to make the product work as advertised.
