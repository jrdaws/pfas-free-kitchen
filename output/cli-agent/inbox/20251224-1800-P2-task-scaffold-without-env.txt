# Task: Enable Export Without Env Vars

Priority: P2
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Medium (~45 min)
Curated By: CURATOR Agent
Quality Score: 9.2/10

## Context
Users report friction when exporting projects with integrations. The CLI 
currently requires environment variables during scaffolding, but should only 
validate at runtime.

## Objectives
1. Remove or defer env validation during export
2. Generate .env.local.example with all required vars
3. Add clear env setup instructions to generated README

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `npx @jrdaws/framework export saas ./test --payments stripe` works without env
- [ ] Generated .env.local.example includes all required variables
- [ ] README includes "Environment Setup" section
- [ ] All existing tests pass: npm test

## Files to Modify
- bin/framework.js (export command)
- src/dd/export.mjs (env validation logic)

## Commands
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
npm test  # Before changes
# Make changes
npm test  # After changes
rm -rf ./test  # Clean up test project

## Handoff
1. Move task to done/
2. Commit: git add -A && git commit -m "feat(cli): allow export without env vars"
3. Update CLI_MEMORY.md
