# Task: Commit Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE)
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)
Cycle: 14
Created: 2025-12-25 16:00

## Context

The repository has **22 uncommitted files** (8 modified + 14 untracked) that have been waiting for 3+ cycles. This dirty git state blocks all forward progress and prevents other agents from seeing the complete repository state.

This is the most urgent task. Nothing else should happen until this is complete.

---

## Objectives

1. Stage all uncommitted files
2. Commit with appropriate message
3. Push to origin/main
4. Verify clean git status

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- [ ] `git push` completes successfully
- [ ] No files remain uncommitted

---

## Execution Commands

```bash
cd /Users/joseph.dawson/Documents/dawson-does-framework
npm test                    # Verify tests pass first
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-14 work (governance, tests, reports, task prompts)"
git push origin main
git status                  # Should show clean
```
