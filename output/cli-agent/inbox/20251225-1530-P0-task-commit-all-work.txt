# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (IMMEDIATE - BLOCKS ALL OTHER WORK)
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Cycle: 13
Quality Score: 9.8/10
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: 5 minutes

---

## Context

Auditor reports 22 files uncommitted for 3+ cycles:
- 8 modified files (FRAMEWORK_MAP, PROJECT_PRIORITIES, AUDITOR_MEMORY, etc.)
- 14 untracked files (governance reports, task drafts, test files)

This is a CRITICAL hygiene issue that blocks all other agents from seeing complete project state.

---

## Objectives

1. Stage all modified and untracked files
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Push to origin/main
4. Verify clean git status

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
- [ ] Commit pushed to origin/main
- [ ] No files lost in process
- [ ] Other agents can now pull complete state

---

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# Sync first
git pull origin main

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Review staged files
git status

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-13 work (governance, tests, reports, UI)"

# Push to origin
git push origin main

# Verify clean state
git status
```

---

## Handoff

1. Confirm commit hash with `git log --oneline -1`
2. Update CLI_MEMORY.md with completion note
3. Report: "T0 COMPLETE - Git clean, all agents unblocked"
4. Next agents can proceed: Testing (T1), Website (T2), Documentation (T4, T5)
