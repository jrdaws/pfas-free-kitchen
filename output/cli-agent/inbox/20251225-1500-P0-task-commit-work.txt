# Task: Commit All Uncommitted Work

Priority: P0 (IMMEDIATE - BLOCKS ALL OTHER WORK)
Assigned To: CLI Agent
Depends On: None
Estimated Effort: Low (5 minutes)

## Context
Auditor reports 22 files uncommitted for 3+ cycles:
- 8 modified files (FRAMEWORK_MAP, PROJECT_PRIORITIES, PROJECT_STATUS, etc.)
- 14 untracked files (governance reports, task drafts, accordion spec)

This blocks all other agents from seeing complete project state.

## Objectives
1. Stage all uncommitted files
2. Create descriptive commit message
3. Push to origin/main

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `git status` shows clean working directory
- [ ] Changes pushed to origin/main
- [ ] Other agents can pull complete state

## Commands to Execute
```bash
git add -A
git status
git commit -m "chore: commit cycles 10-12 work (governance, tests, reports, tasks)"
git push origin main
```

## Handoff
1. Confirm commit hash
2. Update CLI_MEMORY.md with commit details
3. Report: "Commit complete, all agents unblocked"
