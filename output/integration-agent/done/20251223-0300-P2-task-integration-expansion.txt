## Context

The integration system is established with auth (Supabase, Clerk, NextAuth), billing (Stripe, Paddle, LemonSqueezy), and AI (OpenAI). We need to plan expansion for Phase 2.

## Task Objectives

1. **Current Integration Audit**
   - Review all integrations in `src/dd/integrations/`
   - Document which are fully implemented vs stubs
   - Identify gaps in test coverage

2. **Priority Integration Roadmap**
   - Survey common user requests (hypothetical)
   - Prioritize next integrations to add:
     - Database: PlanetScale, Neon, Turso?
     - Email: Resend, Postmark, SendGrid?
     - Analytics: Plausible, Fathom, Posthog?
     - Storage: Cloudinary, UploadThing?

3. **Integration Architecture Review**
   - Document the integration plugin pattern
   - Identify any architectural improvements needed
   - Consider integration composability

4. **Implementation Guide**
   - Create guide for adding new integrations
   - Document the provider interface
   - Add example integration template

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Current integration inventory complete
- [ ] Priority roadmap created
- [ ] Integration architecture documented
- [ ] Implementation guide created

## Files to Review

- `src/dd/integrations/providers/`
- `src/dd/integrations/integration-system.mjs`
- `templates/*/template.json` - Integration configurations

## Handoff

When complete:
1. Move this file to `output/integration-agent/done/`
2. Create completion report in `output/integration-agent/outbox/`
3. Create RFC for top priority integrations
