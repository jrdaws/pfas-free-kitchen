# What is PFAS?

## The Basics

PFAS (pronounced "PEE-fass") stands for **per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances** — 
a family of over 15,000 synthetic chemicals that have been manufactured since 
the 1940s.

These chemicals contain strong carbon-fluorine bonds, which are among the 
strongest bonds in organic chemistry. This makes PFAS extremely stable and 
resistant to:
- Heat
- Water
- Oil
- Stains
- Chemical degradation

Because they don't break down easily in the environment or in the human body, 
PFAS are often called **"forever chemicals."**

## Where Are PFAS Found?

PFAS are used in many consumer and industrial products:

### Kitchen Products
- **Nonstick cookware** (Teflon and similar coatings)
- **Stain-resistant food packaging** (microwave popcorn bags, fast food wrappers)
- **Some food storage containers** (treated plastics)
- **Certain kitchen textiles** (stain-resistant tablecloths)

### Other Products
- Waterproof clothing and outdoor gear
- Stain-resistant carpets and upholstery  
- Firefighting foams (AFFF)
- Some cosmetics and personal care products
- Industrial applications

## PFAS in Cookware: A Brief History

### 1938: Discovery of PTFE
Roy Plunkett accidentally discovered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) at DuPont. 
The substance was trademarked as "Teflon" in 1945.

### 1954: First Nonstick Pan
French engineer Marc Grégoire applied PTFE to fishing gear, then his wife 
suggested using it on cookware. The company Tefal was born.

### 1961: US Introduction
Tefal cookware launched in the United States, becoming popular throughout 
the 1960s and 70s.

### 2000s: Health Concerns Emerge
Research began linking PFOA (a chemical used to make PTFE) to health effects. 
DuPont and other manufacturers faced lawsuits.

### 2006: EPA Stewardship Program
Major manufacturers agreed to phase out PFOA by 2015.

### 2015-Present: PFOA Phaseout
PFOA largely eliminated in US manufacturing, but:
- Replaced with other PFAS (e.g., GenX, PFBS)
- PTFE itself still contains fluorine
- Concerns about the entire class of PFAS chemicals continue

## Health Concerns

Research has associated PFAS exposure with various health effects. According 
to the EPA and peer-reviewed studies:

### Established Associations
- Increased cholesterol levels
- Changes in liver enzyme levels
- Decreased vaccine response in children
- Increased risk of kidney cancer (PFOA)
- Increased risk of testicular cancer (PFOA)

### Areas of Active Research
- Thyroid disease
- Immune system effects
- Reproductive effects
- Developmental effects

### Important Context

**Exposure routes matter.** Most PFAS exposure comes from:
1. Drinking water (near contaminated sites)
2. Food (from packaging or bioaccumulation)
3. Consumer products (direct contact or dust)

The relative contribution of cookware to overall PFAS exposure is debated 
and depends on many factors, including cooking temperature and cookware condition.

## PFAS-Free Alternatives for Cookware

Materials that do not contain PFAS:

### Naturally PFAS-Free
| Material | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Stainless Steel** | Contains no coatings. Excellent for searing. |
| **Cast Iron** | Seasoned with oil, not synthetic coatings. |
| **Carbon Steel** | Similar to cast iron, lighter weight. |
| **Glass** | Inherently inert and non-reactive. |
| **Ceramic (true)** | Kiln-fired clay glazes. Not the same as "ceramic coating." |
| **Enameled Cast Iron** | Glass-based enamel coating on cast iron. |

### Often Marketed as PFAS-Free (Verify Carefully)
| Material | Caution |
|----------|---------|
| **"Ceramic Coating"** | Sol-gel coatings may or may not contain PFAS. Verify with manufacturer. |
| **Anodized Aluminum** | Often combined with nonstick coatings. Uncoated versions are PFAS-free. |

---

## Understanding "PFOA-Free" vs "PFAS-Free"

**These are not the same thing.**

- **PFOA** (perfluorooctanoic acid) is ONE specific PFAS compound
- **PFAS** is the entire CLASS of over 15,000 compounds

A product labeled "PFOA-Free" may still contain:
- PTFE (Teflon) — a type of PFAS
- Other PFAS compounds (PFOS, GenX, PFBS, etc.)

**True PFAS-free** means no fluoropolymers or fluorinated compounds in any 
component.
