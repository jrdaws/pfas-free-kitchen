# About PFAS-Free Kitchen

## Our Mission

We believe everyone deserves access to clear, honest information about the 
products they use every day.

PFAS-Free Kitchen exists to help consumers find kitchen products that have 
been verified to be free of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — without 
the marketing spin or greenwashing.

---

## What We Do

### Independent Verification
We don't just list products that claim to be PFAS-free. We verify those 
claims through:
- Material analysis
- Documentation review
- Independent laboratory testing
- Ongoing monitoring programs

### Transparent Reporting
Every product listing shows:
- Exactly what we verified
- What evidence we have
- What we don't know
- When the information was last updated

### No Sponsored Rankings
Our verification tiers are never influenced by:
- Advertising relationships
- Affiliate partnerships
- Brand payments
- Free products

---

## How We're Funded

We earn money through affiliate commissions when you click through to 
retailers and make a purchase. This comes from the retailer — not from you.

**Important:** Affiliate relationships never influence our verification 
ratings. A product's tier is determined solely by the quality of evidence 
available, not by whether we can earn a commission on it.

We also may earn revenue through:
- Display advertising (clearly labeled)
- Sponsored content (clearly disclosed)

We do NOT accept payment for:
- Product reviews
- Verification ratings
- Search ranking or placement

---

## Our Editorial Policy

### Independence
We maintain complete editorial independence. Our content team makes all 
decisions about what to publish and how to rate products.

### Accuracy
We strive for accuracy in everything we publish. When we make mistakes, 
we correct them promptly and transparently.

### Updates
Kitchen products can change. We date all our verifications and update 
listings when we receive new information. If a product's status changes, 
we update it — even if that change is negative.

### Conflicts of Interest
We disclose all material relationships that could influence our content, 
including affiliate partnerships, advertising relationships, and any free 
products we receive for review purposes.

# Affiliate Disclosure

**Last Updated: January 2026**

This page contains important disclosures about how PFAS-Free Kitchen earns 
money and our relationships with the companies whose products we discuss.

---

## How We Earn Money

PFAS-Free Kitchen is a participant in various affiliate programs. When you 
click on links to retailers and make a purchase, we may earn a commission 
at no additional cost to you.

### Amazon Associates Program

PFAS-Free Kitchen is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates 
Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for 
sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.

**As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.**

### Other Affiliate Programs

We may also participate in affiliate programs with:
- Williams Sonoma
- Sur La Table
- Target
- Walmart
- Other retailers as disclosed on individual product pages

---

## What This Means for You

### No Extra Cost
When you purchase through our affiliate links, the price you pay is the 
same as if you visited the retailer directly. The commission comes from 
the retailer, not from you.

### Our Commitment to Honesty
Affiliate relationships **never** influence:
- Our verification ratings
- Product recommendations
- Search results or rankings
- Editorial content

A product's verification tier is determined solely by the quality of 
evidence available — not by whether we earn a commission.

### Products Without Affiliate Links
We list many products for which we have no affiliate relationship. We 
believe comprehensive coverage is more important than only listing products 
where we can earn commissions.

---

## How to Identify Affiliate Links

Links to retailers on our site may be affiliate links. You can generally 
identify these because:
- They link to product pages on retailer websites
- They may contain tracking parameters in the URL
- They appear in "Shop This Product" sections

When you see a link to buy a product, assume it may be an affiliate link.

---

## Editorial Independence

Our editorial team maintains complete independence from our business team. 
Decisions about what products to list, how to rate them, and what content 
to publish are made without regard to affiliate relationships.

**We do not:**
- Accept payment for positive reviews
- Allow affiliates to influence ratings
- Remove negative information because of business relationships
- Prioritize products based on commission rates

---

## Product Review Disclosure

### Products We Purchase
Most products we review are purchased by us at retail price. These purchases 
are funded by affiliate commissions and other revenue.

### Products Provided for Review
Occasionally, manufacturers provide products for review purposes. When this 
occurs, we disclose it on the product page. Receiving a free product does 
not guarantee a positive review or any particular rating.

### Lab Testing Costs
Laboratory testing is expensive. In some cases, brands may pay for or 
provide lab testing results. We disclose the source of all lab reports on 
product pages. Regardless of who paid for testing, our interpretation of 
results is independent.
