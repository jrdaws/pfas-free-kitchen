# How We Verify Products

At PFAS-Free Kitchen, we don't just take manufacturers at their word. We use 
a rigorous, multi-tier verification system to evaluate every product we list.

---

## Our Verification Philosophy

### 1. Transparency Over Marketing
We show you exactly what we know — and what we don't know — about each product.
Every product page displays:
- The verification tier
- The type of evidence we have
- Any unknowns or limitations

### 2. Conservative Claims
We never claim a product is "safer" or "healthier." We only state what we can 
verify: whether PFAS are present or absent based on available evidence.

### 3. Component-Level Analysis
A product isn't just one thing. A pan has a cooking surface, handle, rivets, 
and possibly a lid. We analyze each component that contacts food.

### 4. No Pay-to-Play
Verification status is never influenced by affiliate relationships or brand 
partnerships. We do not accept payment for reviews or placement.

---

## The Four Verification Tiers

### Tier 4: Monitored ✓✓
**The highest level of verification**

Products at this tier have:
- Independent laboratory testing on file
- A documented retest schedule (typically annual)
- Ongoing access to new test results
- Immediate updates if results change

**How products reach Tier 4:**
1. Meet all Tier 3 requirements first
2. Brand commits to ongoing testing program
3. We verify retest schedule and receive results
4. Continued monitoring for at least one testing cycle

**What Tier 4 means for you:**
These products have the most robust verification. If something changes in 
manufacturing or if new testing reveals issues, we'll know and update the 
listing immediately.

---

### Tier 3: Lab Tested ✓
**Independent laboratory verification**

Products at this tier have:
- At least one independent lab report on file
- Testing method appropriate for PFAS detection
- Clear documentation of what was tested
- Results showing PFAS below detection limits OR quantified results

**Types of lab testing we accept:**

| Method | What It Detects | Detection Limit |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **LC-MS/MS** (Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry) | 30-50+ specific PFAS compounds | 0.1-5 ng/g typically |
| **Total Fluorine Screening** (CIC, PIGE) | Total organic fluorine (all PFAS) | 10-100 ppm typically |
| **Total Organic Fluorine** (TOF) | All fluorinated organic compounds | Varies by method |

**We verify:**
- Lab is accredited (ISO 17025 or equivalent)
- Test method is validated for the matrix (metal, ceramic, etc.)
- Sample description matches the product
- Detection limits are stated
- Chain of custody is documented

**Limitations:**
- A single lab test represents one sample from one production run
- Manufacturing can change over time
- Lab tests don't guarantee future production

---

### Tier 2: Policy Reviewed ○
**Documentation review without independent testing**

Products at this tier have:
- Written documentation from the manufacturer
- Material specifications or safety data sheets
- Supply chain documentation
- OR materials that are inherently PFAS-free

**Types of evidence at Tier 2:**

**Inherent Material Analysis:**
Some materials cannot contain PFAS by their nature:
- Stainless steel (metal alloy, no coatings)
- Cast iron (iron with oil seasoning only)
- Carbon steel (iron alloy with oil seasoning)
- Borosilicate glass (no coatings)
- Kiln-fired ceramic (clay and mineral glazes)

For these products, we verify the material composition and confirm no 
additional coatings are applied.

**Brand Documentation:**
- Official PFAS-free policy on company letterhead
- Material safety data sheets (MSDS/SDS)
- Supplier certifications
- Detailed ingredient/material lists

**What Tier 2 means:**
We have reasonable confidence based on documentation, but no independent 
laboratory verification. The manufacturer's claims have not been tested 
by a third party.

---

### Tier 1: Brand Statement ·
**Unverified brand claims**

Products at this tier have:
- A public statement that the product is PFAS-free
- Marketing materials claiming "non-toxic" or similar
- Customer service confirmations

**We have NOT verified:**
- The accuracy of these claims
- The basis for these claims
- Whether claims apply to all components

**Why we list Tier 1 products:**
We include these products because consumers are searching for PFAS-free 
options, and we want to be a comprehensive resource. However, we clearly 
indicate that these claims are not independently verified.

**What you should know:**
Brand statements can be:
- Accurate but unverified
- Based on different definitions of "PFAS-free"
- Outdated if manufacturing has changed
- Limited to certain components only

---

### Tier 0: Unknown ?
**No verification information available**

Products at Tier 0:
- Have no publicly available PFAS information
- Have not responded to our information requests
- Have ambiguous or unclear material composition

**We typically do not list Tier 0 products** unless they are commonly 
searched for and we want to inform consumers about the lack of information.

---

## Component-Level Verification

### Why Components Matter

Consider a typical nonstick pan:
- **Cooking surface:** PTFE coating (contains PFAS)
- **Pan body:** Aluminum (PFAS-free)
- **Handle:** Bakelite with rubber grip (unknown)
- **Rivets:** Stainless steel (PFAS-free)

Even "PFAS-free" pans may have components we can't verify:
- Handle coatings
- Lid gaskets
- Decorative elements

### How We Report Components

Each product page shows:
1. **All identified components**
2. **Which components contact food**
3. **Material of each component**
4. **Coating (if any) on each component**
5. **PFAS status of each component**

If we can't verify a component, we mark it as "Unknown" and note this as 
a limitation.

---

## Evidence Types

### Lab Reports (Strongest Evidence)
- Independent third-party testing
- Accredited laboratory
- Validated test method
- Clear sample identification
- Quantitative results with detection limits

### Material Analysis
- Chemical composition documentation
- Material safety data sheets
- Engineering specifications
- Industry standard materials

### Brand Documentation
- Official company policies
- Supplier certifications
- Manufacturing documentation
- Responses to direct inquiries

### Public Statements
- Website claims
- Marketing materials
- Press releases
- Social media statements

---

## How We Handle Unknowns

We are transparent about what we don't know:

### Unknown Components
If we can't verify a component, we:
1. List it as "Unknown" in the component table
2. Note this limitation in the verification summary
3. Lower the overall tier if the unknown affects food-contact surfaces

### Changing Products
Products can change without notice. We:
1. Date all evidence
2. Note when evidence was last updated
3. Encourage users to verify current products with manufacturers
4. Update listings when we receive new information

### Regional Variations
Some products have different formulations in different markets. We:
1. Specify which region/market our verification applies to
2. Note when we know about regional variations
3. Default to US market unless otherwise specified
