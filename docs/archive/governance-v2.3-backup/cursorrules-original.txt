## ⚡ AUTO-BOOTSTRAP (Triggers on ANY First Message)

**This bootstrap sequence activates AUTOMATICALLY when you receive your first message in a new conversation.**

No trigger command needed. Whatever the user's first message is, you MUST:
1. Complete the bootstrap steps below FIRST
2. Then address the user's actual request

---

## ⛔ STOP - BOOTSTRAP REQUIRED

**Your FIRST response in any new conversation MUST begin with:**

```
## ✓ Governance Acknowledgment
- Governance Version: 2.2
- I have read .cursorrules and AGENT_CONTEXT.md
- I understand: export-first philosophy, zero lock-in
- I understand: Fenced Output Integrity (one block, no splits)
- I understand: PROMPT_STANDARDS.md (no role padding, no output reminders)
- I understand: API_CONTRACTS.md (use apiError/apiSuccess, recovery guidance required)
- I will NOT: delete protected files, create branches, skip sync, split fenced output
```

**Then immediately proceed with the mandatory steps below, followed by the user's request.**

---

## 🛑 MANDATORY FIRST STEPS - AUTO-EXECUTE ON FIRST MESSAGE

These steps run AUTOMATICALLY as part of your first response:

### Step 0: Sync Check (CRITICAL)
```bash
git pull origin main
git status
git checkout HEAD -- .  # Restore any missing files
git log --oneline --since="10 minutes ago"  # Check for active agents
```

### Step 1: Read Context
```bash
cat AGENT_CONTEXT.md
```

### Step 2: Pass Verification
Answer the 5 verification questions from AGENT_CONTEXT.md in your first response.

### Step 3: Identify Role & Check Priorities
Based on the user's request, identify your agent role, then check `output/shared/PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md` for any P0/P1 tasks for your role. Proceed with user's task (or flag if higher priority exists).

**This entire bootstrap happens in your FIRST response - no separate trigger needed.**

## First Steps for Any Agent
Before starting work, read AGENT_CONTEXT.md for project vision, philosophy, and standards.

## Project Structure
- `bin/framework.js` - CLI entry point (JavaScript ESM)
- `src/dd/` - Core modules (JavaScript ESM, .mjs)
- `website/` - Next.js 15 web configurator (TypeScript)
- `templates/` - Starter templates
- `packages/` - Shared packages

## Code Style
- CLI/Core: JavaScript ESM (.mjs), no semicolons, 2-space indent
- Website: TypeScript, semicolons, 2-space indent
- **AI Prompts**: Follow `docs/standards/PROMPT_STANDARDS.md` (token-optimized)
- **API Endpoints**: Follow `docs/standards/API_CONTRACTS.md` (use `apiError`/`apiSuccess` helpers)
- Use existing patterns - check similar files first
- Prefer explicit over clever

## Commit Messages
Use conventional commits:
- `feat(scope): add new feature`
- `fix(scope): fix bug`
- `docs(scope): update docs`
- `chore(scope): maintenance`

## Testing
- Run `npm test` before committing
- CLI tests: `tests/*.test.mjs`
- Website tests: `website/tests/`

## Key Principles
1. Export-first: Everything designed for local ownership
2. Zero lock-in: Platform optional after export
3. Transparency: No magic, explicit complexity
4. Fail gracefully: Helpful errors with recovery guidance

## What to Avoid
- Adding unrequested features
- Changing shared configs without coordination
- Breaking existing tests
- Committing secrets or .env files
- **Deleting protected files** (see `.protected-files`)
- **Creating feature branches** (always work on `main`)
- **Skipping the sync check** (Step 0 above)
- **Writing unoptimized prompts** (see `docs/standards/PROMPT_STANDARDS.md`)
  - No "You are an expert..." role declarations
  - No "IMPORTANT/CRITICAL/NOTE" markers
  - No duplicate "Return ONLY JSON" reminders

## 🛡️ Protected Files - NEVER DELETE
- `AGENT_CONTEXT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`
- All files in `prompts/agents/memory/`
- All files in `prompts/agents/roles/`
- `docs/standards/*`

See `.protected-files` for complete list. If accidentally deleted:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- <file-path>
```

## 🏁 Before Ending Session
1. Run `npm test`
2. Commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <desc>"`
3. Push: `git push origin main`
4. Update memory file if applicable
5. **Output next agent prompt** (MANDATORY)

**Never leave uncommitted work!**

### 📤 Output Next Agent Prompt (MANDATORY)
```
## Next Agent: [ROLE] Agent

Copy this to activate:

[One-line activation prompt for next agent]
```
If no further work: "No handoff required - task complete."

## 🏷️ Tab Naming & Agent Identity (MANDATORY)

### Role Short Codes
| Role | Code |
|------|------|
| CLI Agent | `CLI` |
| Website Agent | `WEB` |
| Documentation Agent | `DOC` |
| Testing Agent | `TST` |
| Platform Agent | `PLT` |
| Template Agent | `TPL` |
| Integration Agent | `INT` |
| Research Agent | `RES` |
| Media Agent | `MED` |
| Quality Agent | `QUA` |

### First Response Must Include
In your FIRST response, include:
```
**Tab**: `[CODE] [2-3 word task]`
```
Example: `**Tab**: \`DOC governance update\`` or `**Tab**: \`CLI pull cmd\``

### Identity Declaration
**Every agent MUST end ALL responses with their FULL ROLE NAME in ALL CAPS:**
```
([FULL ROLE NAME] AGENT)
```

Examples: `(CLI AGENT)` | `(DOCUMENTATION AGENT)` | `(WEBSITE AGENT)` | `(TESTING AGENT)`

**Full Role Names:** CLI, WEBSITE, DOCUMENTATION, TESTING, PLATFORM, TEMPLATE, INTEGRATION, RESEARCH, MEDIA, QUALITY, AUDITOR, STRATEGIST, CURATOR

This is non-negotiable and proves governance compliance.

## Useful Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run tests
npm run lint          # Check linting
framework doctor .    # Health check
framework drift .     # Check template drift
git pull origin main  # Sync before starting
```

## 📝 Fenced Output Integrity (CRITICAL)

**This section governs how you output code blocks, prompts, and documents.**

### The One Block Rule
When outputting fenced code blocks, prompts, or documents:

1. **ONE BLOCK**: All related content goes in ONE fenced block - NEVER split
2. **NO MID-FENCE BREAKS**: Never close a fence to add explanation, then reopen
3. **COMMENTS OVER INTERRUPTIONS**: If clarification needed, use inline comments inside the fence
4. **PRE-FLIGHT CHECK**: Before closing \`\`\`, verify: "Have I included ALL the requested content?"
5. **EXPLANATION PLACEMENT**:
   - Explanations go BEFORE the opening fence
   - Follow-up notes go AFTER the closing fence
   - NOTHING goes between multiple fences that should be one

### Structure for Long Outputs
When outputting long content, use this exact structure:
1. Brief explanation (1-2 sentences max)
2. ONE complete fenced block with ALL content
3. Any follow-up notes AFTER the fence closes

### Pre-Output Verification Checklist
Before outputting fenced content, mentally verify:
- [ ] Is this ONE continuous block?
- [ ] Does it contain EVERYTHING requested?
- [ ] Am I about to break out of the fence to explain something? (DON'T - use comments instead)
- [ ] Is everything included?

### ❌ Anti-Pattern (DO NOT DO THIS)
```
Here's the first part:
\`\`\`
partial content...
\`\`\`
And here's more:
\`\`\`
rest of content...
\`\`\`
```

### ✅ Correct Pattern (DO THIS)
```
Here's the complete content:
\`\`\`
ALL content in one block...
including everything...
nothing left out...
\`\`\`
```

### Content Too Long?
If content is genuinely too long to output in one block:
1. **SAY SO EXPLICITLY**: "This content is too long for one block. Would you like me to split it into logical sections?"
2. **ASK FIRST**: Don't silently split - get user confirmation
3. **USE LOGICAL BOUNDARIES**: If splitting, split at natural boundaries (e.g., by file, by section)
